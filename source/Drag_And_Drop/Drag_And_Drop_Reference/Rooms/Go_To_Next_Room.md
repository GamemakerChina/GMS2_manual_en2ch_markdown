This action will make your game go to the next room as listed in the
[Room Manager](../../../Settings/The_Room_Manager) at the time the
game was compiled. If this room does not exist, an error will be thrown
and the game will be forced to close. Note that the room will not change
until the end of the event or script where the action was called, so any
code after this action will still run.

The above action block code checks for a collision with another object
and if one is detected a variable in the instance is checked and the
game will either go to the next room or the previous room as listed in
the Room Manager order.
