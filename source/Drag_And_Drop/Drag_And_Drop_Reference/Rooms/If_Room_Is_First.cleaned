   If Room Is First
  </h1>
  This action will check to see if the current room is the first room as listed in the
  <a href="../../../Settings/The_Room_Manager.htm">
   Room Manager
  </a>
  . The action will return
  <span>
   true
  </span>
  if the current room is the first in the Room ManagerÂ and
  <span>
   false
  </span>
  if it is not. You can flag the
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  checkbox to turn this into "If Room Is NOT first".
  
  
   Note that to add actions into the "if" block, they should be dropped to the side of the action, as shown in the image below:
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Rooms/Room_Is_First_Drop.png"/><br/>
  These actions will now be run if the "if" evaluates to
  <span>
   true
  </span>
  , while any actions
    dropped elsewhere will be performed after the "if" block.
