   If Room Is Last
  </h1>
  This action will check to see if the current room is the last room as listed in the
  <a href="../../../Settings/The_Room_Manager.htm">
   Room Manager
  </a>
  . The action will return
  <span>
   true
  </span>
  if the current room is the last in the Room Manager and
  <span>
   false
  </span>
  if it is not. You can flag the
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  checkbox to turn this into "If Room Is NOT Last".
  
  
   Note that to add actions into the "if" block, they should be dropped to the side of the action, as shown in the image below:
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Rooms/Room_Is_Last_Drop.png"/><br/>
  These actions will now be run if the "if" evaluates to
  <span>
   true
  </span>
  , while any actions
    dropped elsewhere will be performed after the "if" block.

  The above action block code checks to see if the current room is
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  the last one as
    listed in the Room Manager. If it is not then the game will go to the next room in the Asset Browser, otherwise it will go to a specific room.
