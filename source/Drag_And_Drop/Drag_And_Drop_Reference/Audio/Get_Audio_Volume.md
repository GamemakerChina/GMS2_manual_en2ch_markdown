This action returns the volume of the given sound. You pick the sound
from the asset explorer and give a target variable to return the volume
value to (you can flag this as being a temporary local variable). The
returned value will be between 0 and 1, where 0 is silent and 1 is full
volume.

The above action block code checks a global variable to see if it is
true or false. If it is true then the volume of the given sound is
retrieved and stored in a temporary local variable. The value is then
checked to see if it is not equal to 0.5, and if it is not, then the
volume of the sound is set to 0.5. If the global variable evaluates to
false , then the sound has its volume set to 1.
