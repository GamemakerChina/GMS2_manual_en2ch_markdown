   Create List
  </h1>
  This action will create a new
  <b>
   list
  </b>
  data-structure and return the index value so you can later access the list through the other Data Structure actions. The list index will be returned to the Target Variable that you supply, which can have been
    created earlier using either
  <a href="../Common/Assign_Variable.htm">
   Assign Variable
  </a>
  or
  <a href="../Common/Declare_Temporary_Variable.htm">
   Declare Temp
  </a>
  , or you can flag the "Temp" checkbox to name and create a temporary local variable
    to store the value until the end of the script or event. A newly created list data structure is considered "empty", ie: it contains no list entries. Note that you can create additional DS lists by clicking the plus icon
  <span>
   <span>
    <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Icon_Expand_Arguments.png"/><br/>
   </span>
  </span>
  beside the action, and selecting another variable to hold the list ID.
  <b>
   IMPORTANT!
  </b>
  Creating any data structure uses up memory on the target platform, and as such all data structures should be free when no longer needed using the action
  <a href="Free_Data_Structure.htm">
   Free Data Structure
  </a>
  otherwise you get a
    memory leak which can impair your games performance or even cause it to crash. This is particularly relevant when using temporary local variables to store data structure indices, as these variables are removed at the end of the code or event, but
    that does not mean the data structure is removed too! The data structure will still exist, only you will have no way to reference it, so either use an instance variable and free the structure at a later time, or free the structure before the end of
    the event or function if its index is stored in a temporary variable.

  The above action block code creates a global scope variable and then creates a new list data
    structure, assigning its index value to the global variable. The scope is then changed to so all the instances of the object "obj_Enemy_Parent" add their unique instance ID value into the list.
