   If Gamepad Button Down
  </h1>
  With this action you can poll a gamepad to see if a given button is currently being held down. The action will return
  <span>
   true
  </span>
  every step that the button is being held down, or
  <span>
   false
  </span>
  otherwise, although if you click the
  <span>
   not
  </span>
  modifier
    you can then check to see if the button is
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  being held, ie: the action will return
  <span>
   true
  </span>
  while no button is down and
  <span>
   false
  </span>
  if there is. If you only need to check for a single button press then use the action
  <a href="If_Gamepad_Button_Pressed.htm">
   If Gamepad Button Pressed
  </a>
  .
  
  
   If the button being checked is an analogue button, then it will not be considered held down until the button value has gone above the threshold set using the action
  <a href="Set_Gamepad_Button_Threshold.htm">
   Set Gamepad Button Threshold
  </a>
  .
  
  
   Note that to add actions into the "if" block, they should be dropped to the side of the action, as shown in the image below:
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Gamepad/a_If_Gamepad_Button_DownDrop.png"/><br/>
  These actions will now be run if the "if" evaluates to
  <span>
   true
  </span>
  ,
    while any actions dropped elsewhere will be performed after the "if" block.

  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Gamepad/e_GamePad_If_Button_Down.png"/><br/>
  The above action block code polls the button state of gamepad 0 every step and if
    a button is being held down it checks for the initial button down press. If the check is
  <span>
   true
  </span>
  on the initial down press, a sound is played, then, while the button is held down, the instance speed is set to 10. If the button is not being held
    down, a check is done on the button release to reset the speed to 0 again.
