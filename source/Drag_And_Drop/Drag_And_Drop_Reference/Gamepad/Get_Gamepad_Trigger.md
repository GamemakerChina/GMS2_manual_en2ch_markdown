You can use this action to get the value of the different triggers from
a given gamepad. You supply the gamepad index (this is the number of
"slot" that a gamepad occupies) and select the the trigger to check
(left or right). The value returned will be between 0 and 1, where 0 is
no pressure on the trigger and 1 full pressure. This returned value will
be stored in the target variable that you supply for future use. Note
that this function does *not* take into account the [threshold
setting](Set_Gamepad_Button_Threshold) .

trigger value is over 0.5 an instance is created at the calling
instance's position.
