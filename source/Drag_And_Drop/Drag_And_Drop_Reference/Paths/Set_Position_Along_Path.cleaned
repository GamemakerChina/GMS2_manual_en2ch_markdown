   Set Position Along Path
  </h1>
  This action will set the position of an instance along a path. The value is normalised from 0 - 1, so if you set it to, for example, 0.5, the instance will be moved to exactly the middle of the path. Note that you must have called the
  <a href="Start_Following_Path.htm">
   Start Following Path
  </a>
  action to assign a path to the instance for this to have any effect.

  The above action block code starts the instance along a path and then generates
    a random decimal value between 0 and 1. This value is stored in a temporary local variable and used to set the position of the instance along the path.
