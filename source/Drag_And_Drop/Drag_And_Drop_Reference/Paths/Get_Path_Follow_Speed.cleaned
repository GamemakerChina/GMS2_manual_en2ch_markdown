   Get Path Follow Speed
  </h1>
  This action will get the speed, in pixels per game frame, that an instance is set to follow a path (note that you must have called the
  <a href="Start_Following_Path.htm">
   Start Following Path
  </a>
  action to assign a path to the instance for this to to
    return a value other than 0). The returned value will be stored in the target variable you give, or you can flag the variable as a temporary local variable to create it and assign the value.
