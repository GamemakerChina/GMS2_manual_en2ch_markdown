   Set Gravity Direction
  </h1>
  This action is used to set the direction of the built in
  <span>
   gravity
  </span>
  variable. Each instance can have it's own gravity effect, and if the gravity value is set to anything other than zero, then the instance will be "pulled" in the
    direction set by this action. You can set a direction between 0° and 360° where right is 0°, up is 90°, left is 180° and down is 270°. Note that you can set this to be relative to the current gravity value, so whatever you input will be added/subtracted
    from that.
