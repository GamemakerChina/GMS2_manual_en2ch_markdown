  This action is used to move an instance from its current position to the position where it was originally created. The original position where an instance is created is stored in two
  <a href="../Instance/Get_Instance_Variable.htm">
   instance variables
  </a>
  called
  <span>
   xstart
  </span>
  and
  <span>
   ystart
  </span>
  . These variables can be used in any other action and can also be set to change the recorded start position.
