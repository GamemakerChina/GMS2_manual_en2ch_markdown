This action is used to set the movement direction of the instance to one
or more random directions chosen from the 8 cardinal points. You can
click one or more of the 8 directional arrows within the action and the
action will choose one of them at random to use as the direction for the
instance. If you select none of the arrows then the action will have no
effect on the current direction of the instance.

The above action block code chooses either true or false andÂ stores the
result in a temporary (local) variable. This variable is then checked
and if it is true then one set of random directions is chosen and if it
false then another set is chosen.
