This action is used to set the force of gravity acting on an instance.
Each instance can have a different gravity force (and direction)
independently of all others. The force applied is a value in pixels per
game frame, and is cumulative, ie: it is added on each step, so if you
have a speed of 2 and a gravity of 1, speed will increment by 1 each
step, meaning that normally you'll want very low values here. Note that
you can input negative values for gravity and the instance will be
"pulled" in the opposite direction to the gravity direction.

#### Example:

The above action block code sets various instance properties related to
movement: gravity direction is set to down (270Â°), gravity force is set
to 0.05, and friction is set to 0.2.
