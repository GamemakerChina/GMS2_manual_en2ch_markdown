   If Key Down
  </h1>
  With this action you can poll the keyboard to see if any key is currently being held down. The action will return
  <span>
   true
  </span>
  every step that the keyboard key is being held down, or
  <span>
   false
  </span>
  otherwise, although if you click the
  <span>
   not
  </span>
  modifier you can then check to see if the key is
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  being help, ie: the action will return
  <span>
   true
  </span>
  while no key is down and
  <span>
   false
  </span>
  if there is. If you only need to check for a single key press then use the action
  <a href="If_Key_Pressed.htm">
   If Key Pressed
  </a>
  .
  
  
   Note that to add actions into the "if" block, they should be dropped to the side of the action, as shown in the image below:
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Mouse_And_Keyboard/a_If_KeyDrop.png"/><br/>
  Any actions dropped elsewhere will be performed after the "if"
    block.

  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Mouse_And_Keyboard/e_KeyboardMouse_KeyDown.png"/><br/>
  The above action block code polls the keyboard state every step and if a key is being
    held down it checks for the initial key down press. If the check is
  <span>
   true
  </span>
  on the initial down press, a sound is played, then, while the key is held down, the sprite blending is changed to red. If the key is not being held down, a check is
    done on the key release to reset the blending colour to white.
