   If Key Pressed
  </h1>
  This action checks for the initial press on a keyboard key. It will return
  <span>
   true
  </span>
  on the single game step (frame) that the key is initially pressed down and
  <span>
   false
  </span>
  at all other times. If you enable the
  <span>
   not
  </span>
  modifier, this action
    will be reversed, and check if the key has
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  been pressed down, returning
  <span>
   false
  </span>
  on the game step (frame) that it has been pressed down and
  <span>
   true
  </span>
  at all other times. If you need to check for a key being held down and not just
    the initial press event, then use the action
  <a href="If_Key_Down.htm">
   If Key Down
  </a>
  .
  
  
   Note that to add actions into the "if" block, they should be dropped to the side of the action, as shown in the image below:
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Mouse_And_Keyboard/a_If_Key_PressedDrop.png"/><br/>
  Any actions dropped elsewhere will be performed after the "if" block.

  The above action block code polls the keyboard state every step and if a key is
    being held down it checks for the initial key down press. If the check is
  <span>
   true
  </span>
  on the initial down press, a sound is played, then, while the key is held down, the sprite blending is changed to red. If the key is not being held down, a check
    is done on the key release to reset the blending colour to white.
