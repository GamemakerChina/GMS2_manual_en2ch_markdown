   Save Game
  </h1>
  This action will do a basic save of the game to a given file. You give a filename (as a string and including the extension) and the action will perform a limited save out of the current game state. It's important to understand that the action is
    designed to take a "snapshot" of the current game state and is for use more as a checkpoint system than a universal save system, since it does
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  save any of the dynamic resources (like
  <a href="../Data_Structures/Data_Structure_Actions.htm">
   Data Structures
  </a>
  or
  <a href="../Particles/Particle_Actions.htm">
   Particles
  </a>
  ). As such the action should be used very carefully so as not to get errors or memory leaks. For a more comprehensive approach to saving your game data, see the
  <a href="../Files/File_Actions.htm">
   File Actions
  </a>

  The above action block code will check for a collision with another instance and if one is found it checks
    an instance variable. If the variable returns
  <span>
   true
  </span>
  then the game is saved and the variable set to
  <span>
   false
  </span>
  .
