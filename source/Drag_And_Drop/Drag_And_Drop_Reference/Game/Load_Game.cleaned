   Load Game
  </h1>
  This action will load a game that has previously been saved using the
  <a href="Save_Game.htm">
   Save Game
  </a>
  action. You give the filename of the file to load (as a string, and including the extension) and the game will be loaded and continue running
    from the saved point. Note that this is not designed as a universal save/load system, and trying to load a game saved from a previous run of the project may give errors (especially if you have used things like
  <a href="../Data_Structures/Data_Structure_Actions.htm">
   Data Structures
  </a>
  or
  <a href="../Particles/Particle_Actions.htm">
   Particles
  </a>
  ), and as such you should only try and load games that have been saved in the progress of a single game play-through (for things like checkpoints). Also note that the file will
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  be loaded until the end of the current event or script, so any actions after the load action is called will still be performed. For a more comprehensive approach to loading saved game data, see the
  <a href="../Files/File_Actions.htm">
   File Actions
  </a>
  .

  The above action block code will check a global variable and if it is less than or equal to
    0 it will load a previously saved game.
