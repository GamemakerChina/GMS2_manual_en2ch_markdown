# Camera ActionÂ Library

  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Cameras/Lib_Camera.png)  
The **Cameras** library has actions that relate to setting the different
variables associated with the camera view. A camera is a point in the
room from which the room is viewed, and the camera view is *what* the
camera sees (and what is drawn to the screen). These actions permit you
to manipulate the different parts of the camera view and define areas of
the room to show through the view position or view size as well as a few
other basic functions. The following actions are available:
