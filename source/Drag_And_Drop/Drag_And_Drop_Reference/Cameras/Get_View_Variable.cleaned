   Get View Variable
  </h1>
  This action permits you to get the value of certain built in variables related to a given
  <b>
   view port
  </b>
  . You select the view port variable to retrieve, then give the view port to target (from 0 to 7) and finally the target variable to hold the returned
    value (this can be flagged as being a temporary local variable). The view port is the area of the screen that will be used to draw a given camera view (as set up in the room editor), and the different variables that you are able to get in this way
    are outlined in the table below:
  <table>
   <tbody>
    <tr>
     <th>
      Variable
     </th>
     <th>
      Description
     </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>
      <span>
       Camera
      </span>
     </td>
     <td>
      The value returned will be the unique ID value of the camera to assigned to the port (see
      <a href="../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Cameras_And_Display/Cameras_And_Viewports/Cameras_And_View_Ports.htm">
       here
      </a>
      for more information).

    <tr>
     <td>
      <span>
       Visibility
      </span>
     </td>
     <td>
      This will return a value of
      <span>
       true
      </span>
      or
      <span>
       false
      </span>
      where
      <span>
       true
      </span>
      is that the view port is visible (ie: it being drawn to the screen), and
      <span>
       false
      </span>
      meaning that nothing is being drawn.

  The above action block code gets the current camera ID assigned to view
    port [0] and then checks to see if it is the same as the one stored in a global variable. If it is not, the camera is set to the new one.
