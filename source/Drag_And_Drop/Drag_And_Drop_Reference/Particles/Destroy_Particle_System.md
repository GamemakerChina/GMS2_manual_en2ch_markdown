#  ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Particles/i_Particles_Destroy_Particle_System.png) Destroy Particle System

This action will "destroy" the given particle system (ie: free up the
memory used by the particle system). You supply the unique ID value for
the system to destroy, as returned when you created the system with the
action [Create Particle System](Create_Particle_System) . This
action should be called whenever you no longer need a particle system in
your game, or whenever you wish to re-create the particle system (for
example, just before calling a [Restart Game](../Game/Restart_Game)
). Note that if the particle system has *not* been flagged as
**Persistent** then you do not need to call this action, as the particle
system (and any emitters associated with it) will be automatically
cleaned up on room end. **IMPORTANT!** This function will also destroy
and remove any emitters that may have been created and associated with
the system being destroyed (see [Create Particle
Emitter](Create_Particle_Emitter) for more information).
