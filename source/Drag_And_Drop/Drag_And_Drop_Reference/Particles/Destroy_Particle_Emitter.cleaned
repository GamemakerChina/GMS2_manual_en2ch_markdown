   Destroy Particle Emitter
  </h1>
  This action will "destroy" the given particle emitter, ie: free up the memory used by the particle emitter. You supply the particle system ID that the emitter belongs to (as returned by the action
  <a href="Create_Particle_System.htm">
   Create Particle System
  </a>
  )
    and then the actual emitter ID (as returned by the action
  <a href="Create_Particle_Emitter.htm">
   Create Particle Emitter
  </a>
  ). This action should be called whenever you no longer need a particle emitter in your game, or whenever you wish to re-create
    the particle emitter (for example, just before calling a
  <a href="../Game/Restart_Game.htm">
   Game Restart
  </a>
  ). Note that if the particle system the emitter has been assigned to has
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  been flagged as
  <b>
   Persistent
  </b>
  then you do
  <i>
   not need to call this action
  </i>
  ,
    as the emitter will be automatically cleaned up on room end along with the particle system.
