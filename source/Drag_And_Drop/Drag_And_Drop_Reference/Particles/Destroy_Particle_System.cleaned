   Destroy Particle System
  </h1>
  This action will "destroy" the given particle system (ie: free up the memory used by the particle system). You supply the unique ID value for the system to destroy, as returned when you created the system with the action
  <a href="Create_Particle_System.htm">
   Create Particle System
  </a>
  .
    This action should be called whenever you no longer need a particle system in your game, or whenever you wish to re-create the particle system (for example, just before calling a
  <a href="../Game/Restart_Game.htm">
   Restart Game
  </a>
  ). Note that if the
    particle system has
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  been flagged as
  <b>
   Persistent
  </b>
  then you do not need to call this action, as the particle system (and any emitters associated with it) will be automatically cleaned up on room end.
  <b>
   IMPORTANT!
  </b>
  This function will also destroy and remove any emitters that may have been created and associated with the system being destroyed (see
  <a href="Create_Particle_Emitter.htm">
   Create Particle Emitter
  </a>
  for more information).
