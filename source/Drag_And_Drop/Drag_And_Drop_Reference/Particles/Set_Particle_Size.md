This action is used to set the particle size, which can be static or set
to increment / decrement over time. You supply the unique ID value for
the type to set the size of (as returned when you created the type with
the action [Create Particle Type](Create_Particle_Type) ) and then
give a range of initial starting sizes, then the increase amount and
finally the "wiggle". The size a particle is created at is a scalar
value, where 1 is the same size as the base particle image, 0.5 would be
half the size of the base image and a value of 2 would be double. If the
minimum and maximum sizes are not the same, then initial size for any
particle created will be a random value between them. The option to
increase a particle size enables you to input a value which will be
added on to the base scalar value each game frame of the particle
lifetime. So setting this value to, for example, 0.1 will add 0.1 to the
scale value each game frame. Note that you can use negative values here
too to make the particle image scale down too. Note that the minimum
scale *decrement* that is accepted is -0.01 and the minimum *increment*
is 0.01. Finally you can set the "wiggle" option. This is a value that
will be generated randomly between 0 and the value you give and then
added or subtracted to the size each step of the particles lifetime,
causing the drawn image to fluctuate in size. Obviously larger values
are more pronounced than smaller ones, and this value can even be a
negative with the maximum range being between -20 and 20.

| Argument | Description                                                                                       |
| Type     | The unique ID value for the particle type to set the size of                                      |
| Min Size | The minimum scale for the particle type (default 0.1)                                             |
| Max Size | The maximum scale for the particle type (default 1)                                               |
| Increase | The value to add on to the particle type size every game frame (can be negative, minimum +/-0.01) |
| Wiggle   | The maximum value to randomly be added or subtracted from the particles size per step (+/-20).    |

#### Example:

The above action block code will create a new particle type and assign
its unique ID value to a global variable. It then proceeds to set all
the properties for the particle type.
