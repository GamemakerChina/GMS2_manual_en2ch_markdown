   Set Particle Size
  </h1>
  This action is used to set the particle size, which can be static or set to increment / decrement over time. You supply the unique ID value for the type to set the size of (as returned when you created the type with the action
  <a href="Create_Particle_Type.htm">
   Create Particle Type
  </a>
  )
    and then give a range of initial starting sizes, then the increase amount and finally the "wiggle". The size a particle is created at is a scalar value, where 1 is the same size as the base particle image, 0.5 would be half the size of the
    base image and a value of 2 would be double. If the minimum and maximum sizes are not the same, then initial size for any particle created will be a random value between them.
  
  
   The option to increase a particle size enables you to input a value which will be added on to the base scalar value each game frame of the particle lifetime. So setting this value to, for example, 0.1 will add 0.1 to the scale value each game frame.
    Note that you can use negative values here too to make the particle image scale down too. Note that the minimum scale
  <i>
   decrement
  </i>
  that is accepted is -0.01 and the minimum
  <i>
   increment
  </i>
  is 0.01.
  
  
   Finally you can set the "wiggle" option. This is a value that will be generated randomly between 0 and the value you give and then added or subtracted to the size each step of the particles lifetime, causing the drawn image to fluctuate in
    size. Obviously larger values are more pronounced than smaller ones, and this value can even be a negative with the maximum range being between -20 and 20.

  The above action block code will create a new particle type and assign its unique
    ID value to a global variable. It then proceeds to set all the properties for the particle type.
