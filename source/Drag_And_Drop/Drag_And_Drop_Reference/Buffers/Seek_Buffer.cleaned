   Seek Buffer
  </h1>
  This action can be used to move (seek) to a position within a buffer. You supply the unique buffer ID value as returned by the action
  <a href="Create_Buffer.htm">
   Create Buffer
  </a>
  and then the offset value in bytes to move to. The offset value will
    be applied from the
  <i>
   start
  </i>
  of the buffer, so calling this function will move the read/write position to the start of the the buffer then move the number of bytes given along and position the new read/write position there. However, if you flag
    the offset as relative, it will move the read/write position forward (or backwards if the offset is a negative value) from the current position.

  The above action block code gets the size of the buffer and then uses that value to set the read/write
    position to the end of the currently stored data.
