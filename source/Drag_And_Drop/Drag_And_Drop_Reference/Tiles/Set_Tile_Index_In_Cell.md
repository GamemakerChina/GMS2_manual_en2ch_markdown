#  ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Tiles/i_Tiles_Set_Tile_In_Cell.png) Set Tile Index In Cell

With this action you can set a tile on a given layer to a new index. The
layer is specified from the layer name given (a string, as used to name
the layer in the Room Editor), and then you give the row and column of
the cell within the layer to get the tile to set. Finally you supply the
tile index to set the tile to (tiles are indexed from left to right from
top to bottom, with 0 at the top left). Note you can always set the tile
index to 0 to clear the tile.

The above action block code creates a loop to go through the top row of
the given room layer, and as it does it checks to see if the tile
indexed at the cell for the column is set to 0. If it is not the tile
index for that cell is set to 0 and the temporary (local) variable is
incremented before the loop does another set of checks.
