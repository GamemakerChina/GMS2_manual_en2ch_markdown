   Get Tile Data Transform
  </h1>
  With this action you can find out if the tile data for a tile has been transformed in one of three ways: flipped, mirrored or rotated. The tile data is simply a value that reflects the index of the tile along with the transforms applied, and you will
    normally want to get the tile data first using either
  <a href="Get_Tile_Data_In_Cell.htm">
   Get Tile Data In Cell
  </a>
  or
  <a href="Get_Tile_Data_At_Pixel.htm">
   Get Tile Data At Pixel
  </a>
  before using this action. The action will return
  <span>
   true
  </span>
  if
    the chosen transform has been applied to the tile-data, or
  <span>
   false
  </span>
  otherwise, and the returned value will then be stored in the target variable which can have been created previously or can be a new temporary one (if you check the "Temp"
    check-box). For more information on tile data, please see the GML section on
  <a href="../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Rooms/Tile_Map_Layers/Tile_Map_Layers.htm">

  The above action block code gets the tile data at the mouse position and then
    checks to see if the tile has had a rotation transform applied to it. If it has then the transform is reset and the tile data sets the tile at the position again.
