   Set Sprite
  </h1>
  This action block sets the
  <span>
   sprite_index
  </span>
  of the instance to another sprite from the Asset Browser. You select the sprite to change to, and then give the image (animation frame) to show. Note that if you don't want the sprite to animate after
    setting the frame, you'll need to use the
  <a href="Set_Animation_Speed.htm">
   Set Animation Speed
  </a>
  action and set it to 0, or if you want the sprite to continue animating then set the value to use the
  <span>
   image_index
  </span>
  built-in variable variable
    instead.
  
  
   Changing the sprite will also change the collision mask of the instance, unless you have also specified a separate
  <span>
   mask_index
  </span>
  in the
  <a href="../../../The_Asset_Editors/Objects.htm">
   Object Editor
  </a>
  . Please note that for changes in this action
    to be visible, the instance should have either
  <i>
   no
  </i>
  draw event (and so
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  will default draw the sprite) or be drawn using
  <a href="../Drawing/Draw_Self.htm">
   Draw Self
  </a>
  action.
