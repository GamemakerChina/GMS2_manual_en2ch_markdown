#  ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Instance/i_Instance_Count.png) Get Instance Count

With this action you can find the number of instances of any given
object currently active within the room. You can select any object from
the resource list or you can use the special keyword [ all
](../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Instance_Keywords) to get
the number of all the instances active. You also need to supply a
*target* variable to return the value to so that you can then use it in
further actions.Â If you flag the target variable as "Temp" then this
will create a new temporary (local) variable to hold the return value
for you, as shown in the example below.

The above action block code creates a local (temporary) variable and
then assigns the number of instances of the object "obj_Squirrel" to it.
This value is then checked and the instance is destroyed if the number
of instances is greater than 100.
