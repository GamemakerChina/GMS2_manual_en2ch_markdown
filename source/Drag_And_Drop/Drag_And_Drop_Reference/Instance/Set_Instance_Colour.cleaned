   Set Instance Colour
  </h1>
  This action block sets the
  <span>
   image_blend
  </span>
  colour for "blending" with the instance sprite. The default value is the hex code $FFFFFFFFÂ (which represents the colour white using
  <a>
   ARGB
  </a>
  format) and this will draw the sprite using no blending and full alpha. Any other value (including internal colour constants like
  <span>
   c_red
  </span>
  , or
  <span>
   c_aqua
  </span>
  ) will
  <i>
   blend
  </i>
  the specified colour with the original sprite as well as set the
  <span>
   image_alpha
  </span>
  component for the instance, but only when the
  <strong>
   Use Alpha
  </strong>
  checkbox is ticked. This will overwrite any alpha value set previously using the action
  <a href="Set_Instance_Alpha.htm">
   Set Instance Alpha
  </a>
  .
  
  
   Please note that for changes in this action to be visible, the instance should have either
  <i>
   no
  </i>
  draw event (and so
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  will default draw the sprite) or be drawn using
  <a href="../Drawing/Draw_Self.htm">
   Draw Self
  </a>
  action. It is
    important to note too that you should try to limit blending on the
  <b>
   HTML5
  </b>
  platform (unless using WebGL), as each blended sprite has to be cached separately and so having many blended sprites may adversely affect performance.
