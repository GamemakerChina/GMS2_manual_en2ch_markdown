   Set Instance Rotation
  </h1>
  This action block sets the
  <span>
   image_angle
  </span>
  (rotation) of the instance. The angle is measured in degrees, with the right being 0°, up being 90°, left being 180° and down being 270°. Set this variable to 0 to reset the instance, meaning that it will
    draw any sprite assigned to as it was defined in the sprite editor. Please note that for changes in this action to be visible, the instance should have either
  <i>
   no
  </i>
  draw event (and so
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  will default draw the sprite) or be drawn
    using
  <a href="../Drawing/Draw_Self.htm">
   Draw Self
  </a>
  action.
