   Set Instance Alpha
  </h1>
  This action block sets the
  <span>
   image_alpha
  </span>
  value for the instance. The image alpha is the "transparency" value for drawing any sprite assigned to the instance and has a value between 0 and 1, where 0 would be fully transparent and 1 would
    be fully opaque. Note that if the sprite has transparent or semi-transparent pixels, then their transparency will be scaled by the amount, so if you have some 50% transparent pixels in the sprite and set the instance alpha to 0.5, the final alpha
    for the transparent pixels would be 25%. You can set this value to be a relative amount
  
  
   Please note that for changes in this variable to be visible, the instance should have either
  <i>
   no
  </i>
  draw event (and so
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  will default draw the sprite) or be drawn using
  <a href="../Drawing/Draw_Self.htm">
   Draw Self
  </a>
  <span>
  </span>
  action.
