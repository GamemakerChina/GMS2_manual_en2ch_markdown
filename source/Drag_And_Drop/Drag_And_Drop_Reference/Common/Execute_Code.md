This action simply adds a [code
editor](../../../The_Asset_Editors/Scripts) block into the GML
Visual list where you can add any valid GML code that you require for
the object. Note that all the code in the action will be run before the
next action in the list is run. To make it easier to track what these
actions do you can name them by using the
[JSDoc](../../../The_Asset_Editors/Code_Editor_Properties/JSDoc_Script_Comments)
@description identifier, as shown in the image below:
