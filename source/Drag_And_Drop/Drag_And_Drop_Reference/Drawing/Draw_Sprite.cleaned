   Draw Sprite
  </h1>
  This action will draw a sprite somewhere in the room. You specify the sprite, the position (either an absolute position within the room, or a relative position to the instance doing the drawing) and the animation frame of the sprite, if it has multiple
    frames (note that image frames are numbered from 0 upwards). If you have an animated sprite and you want it to draw the frames as if it was assigned to the object, then use -1 for the frame index or the built in instance variable
  <span>
   image_index
  </span>
  ,
    but note that if the instance has no sprite assigned then it will not animate, and if the sprite assigned has a different number of frames to the one being drawn then the sprite will be drawn with extra frames or missed frames.
  <b>
   IMPORTANT:
  </b>
  This action will not draw the sprite transformed, even if you have changed the image blend or scale. For that see the action
  <a href="Draw_Sprite_Transformed.htm">
   Draw Sprite Transformed
  </a>
  .
