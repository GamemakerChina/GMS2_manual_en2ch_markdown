   Draw Instance Score
  </h1>
  With this action you can draw the score value of the instance. When you use
  <i>
   any
  </i>
  score action in
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  the instance that calls it will have a new instance scope variable called
  <span>
   score
  </span>
  added. This variable can then be checked
    and set as you would any other variable. In the case of this action, the variable will be drawn to the screen at the given position, along with any caption text that you wish to provide. Caption text will be drawn preceding the score value and if
    it is text it should be wrapped with "", and both will be formatted using the current draw font , colour and alignment.
