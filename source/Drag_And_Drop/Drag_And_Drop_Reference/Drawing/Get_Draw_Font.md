With this action you can get the ID value of the font currently assigned
for drawing. The value returned will be either -1 for no font assigned,
or a value \>= 0 that represents a font constant from the Asset
Browser.Â The return value will be stored in the **target variable** that
you specify, which can have been created previously or can be a new
temporary one (if you check the "Temp" check-box).
