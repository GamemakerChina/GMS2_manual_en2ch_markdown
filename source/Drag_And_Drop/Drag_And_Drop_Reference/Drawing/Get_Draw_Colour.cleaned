   Get Draw Colour

  With this action you can get the colour being used for any shapes (rectangle/ellipse/line) or for any text that is drawn. The action will return the colour to the
  <b>
   target variable
  </b>
  that you specify, which can have been created previously or can
    be a new temporary one (if you check the "Temp" check-box).
