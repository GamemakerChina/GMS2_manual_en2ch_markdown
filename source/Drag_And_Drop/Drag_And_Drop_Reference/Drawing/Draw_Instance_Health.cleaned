   Draw Instance Health
  </h1>
  With this action you can draw a coloured bar to show a graphic representation of the instance variable
  <span>
   health
  </span>
  (when you use
  <i>
   any
  </i>
  "health" action in
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  the instance that calls it will have a new instance scope
    variable called
  <span>
   health
  </span>
  added). The amount to be displayed is a percentage value that falls within the range of 0 - 100. You can set the direction anchor for drawing the healthbar (from left-to-right or right-to-left and top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top)
    as well as the position, either within the room or relative to the instance calling the action. You can also set the colour to be blended from each of the four corners of the healthbar, creating gradients from red to green (for example, but you can
    use any colours). Below you can see an image of how a simple healthbar looks with the different options:
