   Draw Sprite Transformed
  </h1>
  This function will draw the given sprite similar to the action
  <a href="Draw_Sprite.htm">
   Draw Sprite
  </a>
  but with additional options to change the scale, blending, rotation and frame of the sprite being drawn. Changing these values does
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  modify
    the resource in any way (only how it is drawn), and you can use any of the available
  <a href="../Instance/Set_Instance_Variable.htm">
   sprite property variables
  </a>
  instead of direct values for all the arguments in the function. The image below illustrates
    how different values affect the drawing of the sprite:

  <b>
   <span>
    NOTE
   </span>
  </b>
  Colour blending is only recommended for the HTML5 target when WebGL is enabled, although you can still set the blending colour if it is not enabled and it will blend the sprite as normal. However all blending in this way creates a duplicate
    sprite which is then stored in the cache and used when required. This is far from optimal and if you use multiple colour changes it will slow down your games performance unless you activate WebGL. if you do not wish to use WebGL, then you can set
    the font cache size to try and limit this should it be necessary using the function

   Example:
  </h4>
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Drawing/e_Drawing_Draw_Sprite_Transformed.png"/><br/>
  The above action block code checks a variable and if it is set to
  <span>
   true
  </span>
  then the sprite is drawn with random scaling along the x and y axis and blended with the colour red, otherwise the sprite is drawn using the default transforms.
