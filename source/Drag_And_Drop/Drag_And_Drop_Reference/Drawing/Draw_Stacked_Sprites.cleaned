   Draw Stacked Sprites
  </h1>
  This action will draw a sprite a given number of sprites one after another at a given position within the room. You give the sprite to draw and the stack order, which can be either
  <b>
   Row
  </b>
  (horizontally, left to right), or
  <b>
   column
  </b>
  (vertically,
    top to bottom), as well as the number of sprites to draw and the position. The position can be an absolute position within the room, or one relative to the position of the instance doing the drawing, and the spacing between images will be based on
    the width or height of the sprite. Note that this simply draws a static image - the initial single image (frame 0) of the given sprite - and any further frames will be ignored, as will any transforms that have been added through changing the

  (like

  </span>
  or

   image_blend
