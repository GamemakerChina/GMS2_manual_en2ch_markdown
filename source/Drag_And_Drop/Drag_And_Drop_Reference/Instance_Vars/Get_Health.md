You can use this action to retrieve the value of the instance variable
created for the "health" of the object. You supply the target variable
to store the returned "health" value (which can be flagged as a
temporary local variable), but note that if the variable has not been
set previously (using [Set Health](Set_Health) ) then the variable
will be created for you and the action will return 0 (unlike regular
instance variables which will give an error if you try to access them
without having set them first).

#### Example:

  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Instance_Vars/e_IV_Get_Health.png)  
The above action block code will retrieve the value for "health" and
store it in a temporary local variable. This variable is then used to
draw a healthbar for the instance.
