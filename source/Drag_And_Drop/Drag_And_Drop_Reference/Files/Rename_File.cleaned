   Rename File
  </h1>
  With this action you can rename any file that has been saved by your game. You give the name of the file to change (as a string) and then the new name (also as a string and including the file extension), and the file will be renamed. Note that you
  <i>
   cannot
  </i>
  rename any file that was bundled as an Included File with your game (see the section on
  <a href="../../../Additional_Information/The_File_System.htm">
   The File System
  </a>
  for more information).

  The above action block code will check to see if the file "checkpoint.sav" exists, and if
    it does it then checks to see if the file "checkpoint_OLD.sav" exists. If that file exists as well, then it is deleted, and then the original "checkpoint.sav" file is renamed to "checkpoint_OLD.sav". Finally a buffer
    is saved as "checkpoint.sav" (essentially we are backing up a saved buffer file each time we save it, so that there is always a "current" save and an "old" save file).
