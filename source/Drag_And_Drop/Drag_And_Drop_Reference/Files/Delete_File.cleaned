   Delete File
  </h1>
  With this action you can delete a file that has been created previously. You supply the file name (as a string) of the file to be deleted. Note that you
  <i>
   cannot
  </i>
  delete any files that are included in the game bundle, only those that have been created
    using the
  <a href="Close_Ini_File.htm">
   Close Ini
  </a>
  or
  <a href="Save_Buffer.htm">
   Save Buffer
  </a>
  actions (see the section on
  <a href="../../../Additional_Information/The_File_System.htm">
   The File System
  </a>
  for more information).

  The above action block code will check to see if the file "checkpoint.sav" exists, and if
    it does it then checks to see if the file "checkpoint_OLD.sav" exists. If that file exists as well, then it is deleted, and then the original "checkpoint.sav" file is renamed to "checkpoint_OLD.sav". Finally a buffer
    is saved as "checkpoint.sav" (essentially we are backing up a saved buffer file each time we save it, so that there is always a "current" save and an "old" save file).
