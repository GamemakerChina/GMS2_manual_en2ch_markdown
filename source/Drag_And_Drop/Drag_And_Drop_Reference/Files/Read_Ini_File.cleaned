   ReadÂ Ini File
  </h1>
  With this action you can read a piece of data from an Ini file. You must previously have opened the Ini file for reading/writing using the action
  <a href="Open_Ini_File.htm">
   Open Ini File
  </a>
  , and then with this action you give the type of data to read
    (either a real number or a string enclosed in ""), as well as the section header and the key within that section to get the data from. You can also supply a default value which can be either a real number of a string, and the type should
    coincide with the "Type" set in the action. This default action will be returned by the action should any of the following occur:
  <ul>
   <li>
    The Ini file you have opened does not exist
   </li>
   <li>
    The section header you reference does not exist
   </li>
   <li>
    The key you are trying to get data from does not exist
   </li>
  </ul>
  Under any of the above circumstances, you will get the default value returned rather than a value from the Ini file. Whatever value is returned will be stored in the target variable that you specify, which can also be created at that moment if flagged
    as a temporary local variable.
  <b>
   IMPORTANT!
  </b>
  trying to read data from an Ini file that has not been opened previously using the
  <a href="Open_Ini_File.htm">
   Open Ini File
  </a>
  action will cause a serious error and crash your game.
