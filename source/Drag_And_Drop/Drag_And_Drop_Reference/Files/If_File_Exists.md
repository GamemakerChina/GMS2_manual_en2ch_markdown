#  ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Files/i_Files_If_File_Exists.png) If File Exists

With this action you can check to see if a file with the given name
exists. You select the file to check for (as a sting and including the
extension) and the function will return true if it exists, and false if
it does not. Note that this will return true if the file exists in the
game bundle as an Included File or if the file has been saved out while
the game was running (see the section on [The File
System](../../../Additional_Information/The_File_System) for more
information). Note that to add actions into the "if" block, they should
be dropped to the side of the action, as shown in the image below:

| Argument | Description                                                                             |

#### Example:

  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Files/e_Files_Load_Buffer.png)  
The above action block code will create a variable to hold buffer data
and then check to see if a buffer save file has been made previously. If
the file exists, then it is loaded into the buffer variable that we
created, but if it doesn't exist, it is created, written to and then
saved out ready for loading the next time.
