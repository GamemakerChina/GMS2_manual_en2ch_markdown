  The
  <b>
   Switches
  </b>
  action library contains those actions that are required for
    creating switch statements in your game action code. In a number of situations you want to let your instances complete an action depending on a particular value, and while you can do this using a number of consecutive "if" statements, this
    can get messy when the possible choices gets above two or three. In these cases it is better to use the "switch" action. A switch action works as follows:
  <ul>
   <li>
    You supply value a (usually from some kind of expression or variable)
   </li>
   <li>
    The value is compared with the value assigned to the various "case" statements
   </li>
   <li>
    If the value is the same as the case value, the contents of the case are performed otherwise the next case is evaluated, etc...
   </li>
   <li>
    Once a case has been performed
    <i>
     or
    </i>
    all cases have been evaluated and failed, the code will continue from the end of the switch
   </li>
   <li>
    If all cases failed and you have a default case, then that will be performed before the code continues from the end of the switch
   </li>
  </ul>
  The
  <b>

  library has the following actions:
  <table>
   <tbody>
