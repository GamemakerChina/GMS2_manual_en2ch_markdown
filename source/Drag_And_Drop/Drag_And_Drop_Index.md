#  GML Visual 

GML Visual is the **visual scripting** method for programming with the
[GameMaker Language](../GameMaker_Language/GameMaker_Language_Index)
(GML). It consists of using **action blocks** to construct game logic in
a visual and intuitive way, and is an ideal tool for people who are
learning programming, or for people that have a more visual inclination.
The GML Visual section of the manual is split into the following
sections:

-   [Overview](Drag_And_Drop_Overview/DnD_Overview)
-   [Reference](Drag_And_Drop_Reference/DnD_Reference)
