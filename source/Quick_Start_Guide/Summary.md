# Summary

We're at the end of this Quick Start Guide and we hope you've gained
enough knowledge and confidence to go and start using GameMaker to make
your own projects! if you've gone through all the pages of this guide,
then you should now know the following:

-   How to create **Sprites** and **Tile Sets** and edit them in the
    **Image Editor**
-   How to create **Objects** and **Rooms**
-   The difference between an **object** and an **instance**

-   Basic programming concepts like **variables** , **functions** and
    **expressions**

You've come a long way in a short time, but that's not the end of the
journey. This manual has two extensive reference sections that cover
every aspect of the IDE and how to program using either GML Visual or
GML, and we highly recommend that you come back here to those sections
whenever you are unsure of something or want to try something new:

-   [IDE Reference](../IDE_Navigation/IDE_Input)
-   [GML Visual​​​​​​​
    Reference](../Drag_And_Drop/Drag_And_Drop_Reference/DnD_Reference)
-   [GML Code
    Reference](../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/GML_Reference)
-   [Additional
    Information](../Additional_Information/Additional_Information)

You can also get a number of GameMaker tutorials from the [Start
Page](../Introduction/The_Start_Page) which use the core concepts
you've learned here to make small and fun games, like [Space
Rocks](https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/7462/space-rocks-dnd) .
For further technical help with things like setting up the different
target platforms you should see the [YoYo Games
Helpdesk](https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/categories/204246668-GameMaker-Studio-2)
, and YoYo Games also run a series of [Tech
Blogs](https://www.yoyogames.com/blog) which cover all sorts of
different aspects of using GameMaker , from the most basic concepts to
the most advanced techniques so there's something there for everybody.
In particular, have a look at the following article:

We would also like to point out that GameMaker has its own forums called
the [GMC](https://forum.yoyogames.com/index.php) ( **G** ame **M** aker
**C** ommunity) which are community run and full of helpful members that
are willing to give up some of their time to help with any programming
or technical issues that you may have. Finally, there are a huge amount
of GameMaker resources around the internet, so always try searching for
infomation in your browser when stuck or looking for tutorials, and
there are also number of active communities on sites like **Reddit** or
**Discord** where you can sign up and participate. Whatever you do, we
hope that you have fun using GameMaker , and if (when!) you do make a
game and publish it, don't forget to drop us a line to tell us about it
for the [GameMaker Showcase](https://www.yoyogames.com/showcase) !
