# Template Info

This section allows you to set information for your project which is
used when it's [exported as a
template](../../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_File_Menu#export) .

Here you can assign an image, icon and description for the template
project, however this will only be used when it's actually exported as a
template. You can do that by opening the [File
Menu](../../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_File_Menu) , hovering on
"Export Project" and selecting "As Template".
