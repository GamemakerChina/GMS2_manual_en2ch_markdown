  windows and tools that will affect how your game is run and performs. In general, you will need to set up most of these on a per-game basis, but note that some are optional and not required (like

  </b>
  ), while the availability of others will depend on the licence that you have (like some of the
  <strong>
   Game options
  </strong>
  ).
