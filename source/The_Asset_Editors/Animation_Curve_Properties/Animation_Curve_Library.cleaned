  The
  <strong>
   Animation Curve Library
  </strong>
  window allows you to change the Curve Type for the Animation Curve, and apply
    a preset to the selected channel. It can be opened by
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"/><br/>
  left-clicking on the
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Animation_Curve_Library_Button.png"/><br/>
  button in the
  <a href="../Animation_Curves.htm">
   Animation Curve Editor
  </a>
  or
  <a href="../Sequence_Properties/Using_Animation_Curves.htm">
   Sequence Dope Sheet
  </a>
  , or by
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png"/><br/>
  right-clicking
    anywhere in the Channel Editor.

  The
  <strong>
   Curve Type
  </strong>
  controls how a channel flows from point to point, which can be set to one of the following options:
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Linear
    </strong>
    : This wll create a linear progression between points on the channel
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Smooth
    </strong>
    : This will use
    <a>
     catmull-rom interpolation
    </a>
    to create a smooth progression between points on the channel
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Bezier
    </strong>
    : This will use Bezier curve mathematics to create a smooth progression between points on the channel, where you can control how the curve looks by manipulating "handles" on the points
   </li>
  </ul>
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Animation_Curves_Types.png"/><br/>
  Note that changing the Curve Type will apply that type to
  <em>
   all
  </em>
  channels in the Animation Curve.

  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"/><br/>
  Left-clicking on a preset in the Presets menu will apply that preset to your
      selected channel, and clicking on
  <strong>
   Reset
  </strong>
  will revert the channel to how it was before the Animation Curve Library window was opened.
  <span>
   <strong>
    NOTE
   </strong>
   : Presets can only be applied if the Curve Type is set to
   <strong>
    Bezier
   </strong>
   .
  </span>

  By default, a preset is applied to the whole channel. You can select a section of your channel by dragging with the
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"/><br/>
  left mouse button in the
  <strong>
   Channel Editor
  </strong>
  , and then open the Animation Curve Library window through the
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Animation_Curve_Library_Button.png"/><br/>
  button or by
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png"/><br/>
  right-clicking, which will apply any presets to the selected section only.
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Animation_Curves_Library_Preset1_Selection.gif"/><br/>
  Note that your curve channel (or selection within that channel) needs to have a slope for a preset to have any effect, as any applied
      interpolation is based on the vertical difference between the starting and ending points. A flat curve has no such difference between the two points, so you will not see any results after applying a preset to such a curve.
   
   
    There are two
  <strong>
   Apply Modes
  </strong>
  that you can choose from, which affects how a preset is applied to your channel (or to your selection within that channel):
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Animation_Curves_Library_Apply_Modes.png"/><br/>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Overwrite:
    </strong>
    This is the default when the window is opened through the
    <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Animation_Curve_Library_Button.png"/><br/>
    button in the Animation Curve Editor or the Sequence Dope Sheet. It overwrites
        any points between the beginning and ending points of your channel or selection.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Between:
    </strong>
    This is the default when the window is opened by
    <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png"/><br/>
    right-clicking anywhere in the Channel Editor. It applies the preset between each pair of selected points,
        and adds any new points that are needed without removing any existing points.
   </li>
  </ul>
  The following visual shows the

  </strong>
  apply modes:
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Animation_Curves_Library_Apply_Modes_Difference.png"/><br/>
  As you can see in the above visual,
  <strong>
   Between
  </strong>
  applies the curve preset to each pair of points, and inserts any new points that are needed.
  <strong>
   Overwrite
  </strong>
  removes any points between the starting and ending points and then
      applies the preset.
   
   
    There are also three
  <strong>
   Easing Modes
  </strong>
  that you can choose from, which controls how a curve accelerates or decelerates. The default easing mode is
  <strong>
   Ease Out
  </strong>
  .
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Animation_Curves_Library_Easings.png"/><br/>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Ease In:
    </strong>
    The curve starts with faster acceleration, and then decelerates
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Ease Out
    </strong>
    : The curve starts with slower acceleration, and then accelerates over time
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Ease In-Out:
    </strong>
    The curve starts with slower acceleration, accelerates over time and then decelerates
   </li>
  </ul>
  The following visual shows the
  <b>
   Quart
  </b>
  curve preset in all three easing modes:
