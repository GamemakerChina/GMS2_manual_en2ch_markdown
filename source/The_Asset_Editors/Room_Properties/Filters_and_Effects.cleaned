   Filter/Effect Layers
  </h2>
  In the Room Editor, you can add a new Filter/Effect layer by clicking on the
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_FX_Layer.png"/><br/>
  button, which will add a new layer and open up its properties below:
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Room_LayerFilterProperties.png"/><br/>
  A Filter/Effect (or FX) layer is used to apply a visual filter or effect to some layers. You can select an effect from the "Effect Type" drop-down list, which will show you its parameters in the Layer Properties window allowing you to modify how it looks and behaves.
  
  
   For example, selecting the "Screen Shake" effect will allow you to change its magnitude, shake speed and apply a sprite as its noise texture:
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Room_LayerFilterParameters.png"/><br/>
  Adding an FX layer will apply the selected effect to all other layers that are
  <em>
   below
  </em>
  the FX layer, as demonstrated in this visual:
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Room_LayerFilterEffectOrder.png"/><br/>
  This means that all "affected" layers will have the selected filter applied to them (here, "Desaturate") as they are below an FX layer. Any layers above the FX layer will be unaffected. A layer may be affected by multiple effect layers that are present above it anywhere in the layer order.
  
  
   To create filters/effects that are applied to only one layer, see:

  at runtime may change which FX layers are applied on it, by either making its depth higher than an FX layer's depth (essentially going

  the FX layer and being affected) or making its depth lower than an FX layer's depth (going
  <em>
   above

  the FX layer and not being affected).
  <h2>
   Filter vs. Effect
  </h2>
  A Filter only uses shaders and can be previewed in the Room Editor.
  
  
   An Effect also has internal code for managing itself in addition to shaders. Due to this, they can't be previewed in the Room Editor, and only appear functional at runtime (in-game).
  
  
   For example, "
  <strong>
   Colourise
  </strong>
  " is a Filter, where "
  <strong>
   Windblown Particles
  </strong>
  " is an Effect.
  <h2>
   Effect Types
  </h2>
  All the Filters and Effects in the
  <strong>
   "Effect Type"
  </strong>
  drop-down list are documented on this page:
  <a href="FX/All_Filter_Effect_Types.htm">
   FX Types &amp; Parameters
  </a>
  .
  <h2>
   Single-Layer FX
  </h2>
  While you can create an FX layer to apply a filter to multiple layers, you are also able to assign a filter to one specific layer only, using the
  <a href="../../IDE_Tools/The_Inspector.htm">
   Inspector
  </a>
  . Opening an Inspector and selecting a room layer will allow you to apply a filter/effect to it, and if that layer is a non-FX layer (e.g. Instance Layer, Asset Layer, etc.) then the effect will only be applied to that layer and not to any other layers below it.
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/IDE%20Tools/Inspector_Room_Layers.png"/><br/>
  You can also click on the
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Eye.png"/><br/>
  icon to enable/disable the FX for the selected layer.
  <h2>
   Runtime Usage
  </h2>
  You can add and control effects at runtime using the
  <a href="../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Rooms/Filter_Effect_Layers/Filter_Effect_Functions.htm">
   Filter/Effect GML Functions
  </a>
  .
  
  
   
    Please note that there are currently only two ways to ensure that GameMaker loads a particular filter/effect in your game:
  <ul>
   <li>
    By adding the filter/effect in
    <strong>
     at least one room
    </strong>
    through the IDE
   </li>
   <li>
    By calling
    <span>
     <a href="../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Rooms/Filter_Effect_Layers/fx_create.htm">
      fx_create()
     </a>
    </span>
    with the filter/effect name as a string
    <a>
     literal
    </a>
   </li>
  </ul>
  This means that to use a specific filter/effect at runtime, it must have either been added into a room first (so GameMaker knows you are going to use it) or specified explicitly in an
  <span>
   <a href="../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Rooms/Filter_Effect_Layers/fx_create.htm">
    fx_create()
   </a>
  </span>
  call.
