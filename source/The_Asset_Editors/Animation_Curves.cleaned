  <h1>
   The Animation Curve Editor
  </h1>
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Animation_Curves.png"/><br/>
  An animation curve is an asset that contains one or more curves that represent how a value changes over time, and can use
  <a>
   linear interpolation
  </a>
  ,
  <a>
   smooth interpolation
  </a>
  or
  <a>
   bezier interpolation
  </a>
  to go between different points in the curve. The values you set on the vertical axis can be between any two values (between -1 and 1 by default) and the duration along the horizontal axis is
  <em>
   always
  </em>
  normalised from 0 to 1, making it easy to
    target different time ranges using multipliers in your game code or stretch them to fit a track in the
  <a href="Sequence_Properties/Using_Animation_Curves.htm">
   Sequences Editor
  </a>
  .
  
  
   Animation curves are comprised of "channels" and each channel can have its own curve settings, which permits you to - for example - describe a spatial position with two channels for the x/y location, or a colour gradient with 4 channels to
    represent a colour format. Animation curve assets can be used when working with Sequences and can also be accessed using code, making them a powerful tool when creating your games.
  
  
   When you first create an animation curve asset the editor window will open and present you with the following sections:
  <a href="#">
   <span>
    Curve Name
   </span>
   <span>
    Curve Name
   </span>
  </a>
  Here you can give your animation curve a unique name (
  <span>
   alphanumeric characters and the "_" underscore symbol only
  </span>
  ). This name is what will be used to refer to the curve and all its channels
      when accessing it through code or in a sequence.

  The

  button opens the
  <strong>

  window,
      which allows you to change the Curve Type of the Animation Curve, and apply a preset to the selected channel.

  See the section on

  for information
      on Curve Types and Presets. Note that opening the window through the

  button will have the
  <strong>

   <span>
    Channel List
   </span>
  </a>
  The channel list is where you can add and name the different channels that will comprise your animation curve asset. By default when you first create an animation curve, a channel will have been added for you and you can add further channels by clicking
      on the
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Animation_Curves_New_Channel.png"/><br/>
  button to the left of the curve name. Each channel must have a unique name (using
  <span>
   alphanumeric characters and the "_" underscore symbol only
  </span>
  ),
      and you can also set the colour for the channel by double clicking
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"/><br/>
  on the colour swatch to the left, which will open the colour picker to let you choose a new colour.
      To rename the channel, you can do a slow double click
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"/><br/>
  and rename, and you can also use the right mouse button
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png"/><br/>
  to open a menu where you can choose to rename, change the colour or delete the channel.
   
   
    Channels can be expanded by clicking on the arrow beside the name to show each of the points on the channel curve, and these points can be edited manually by clicking the current value and typing in the new value.
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Animation_Curves_ExpandList.png"/><br/>
  You can toggle the channel visibility by clicking on the "eye" icon
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_ToggleVisibility.png"/><br/>
  , or delete the channel by clicking the "bin" icon

  The Channel Range button is used for setting the visual vertical range for the Channel Editor. By default this will be set from -1 to 1, but clicking this button will open the following window:
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Animation_Curves_Range.png"/><br/>
  Changing these values will change the way the data is represented in the Channel Editor section, permitting you
      to have higher/lower values along the channel curve than just -1 to 1. Note that this is purely visual and does not clamp the values for the channel.
  <a href="#">

   <span>
    Channel Editor
   </span>
  </a>
  The Channel Editor shows a visual representation of the different channels used in the animation curve. By default, all channels will be shown here, but you can only edit the channel currently selected from the Channel List, which will be highlighted
      in the editor. You can change the position of any of the points along the channel curve by clicking
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"/><br/>
  on them and dragging them around within the editor, but note that the
      first and last point can only be changed along the vertical axis and their horizontal value will always be 0 and 1 respectively.
   
   
    You can add points directly to the channel curve by moving the mouse close to the main channel line and then clicking
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"/><br/>
  when the cursor changes to the "
  <strong>
   Add Point
  </strong>
  "
      tool, and you can then edit these points by clicking
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"/><br/>
  and dragging or by changing their values in the expanded channel options in the Channel List:
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Animation_Curves_Channel_Editor.gif"/><br/>
  You can edit multiple points at once by clicking
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"/><br/>
  and dragging within the editor to select all the points you want to edit or by using

  +
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"/><br/>
  to add points to the selection individually. Releasing the mouse button and then clicking again on any of the points in the selection
      and dragging will move them all together:
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Animation_Curves_Channel_Editor_Moving.gif"/><br/>
  You can
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png"/><br/>
  right-click anywhere in the Channel Editor to open the
  <a href="Animation_Curve_Properties/Animation_Curve_Library.htm">
   Animation Curve Library
  </a>
  window (only when the selected Curve Type is
  <strong>
   Bezier
  </strong>
  ). Applying a preset in this way will affect the whole channel. To modify only a part of the channel, you can
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png"/><br/>
  right-click on an individual line to apply a preset to it, or select multiple lines by clicking
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"/><br/>
  and dragging, then
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png"/><br/>
  right-click on the selection to apply a preset to the selected lines.
