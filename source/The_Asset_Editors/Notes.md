The **Note Editor** will open a code/script window where you can keep
notes and code snippets or any other information that you consider
relevant to the project. You can create multiple notes and name them
from the right mouse button

menu in the [Asset Browser](../Introduction/The_Asset_Browser) .
Notes can also be grouped and re-ordered like any other asset. If you
have imported a project created using a previous version of GameMaker ,
then you will also find a [Compatibility
Report](../Additional_Information/Compatibility_Scripts) included as
a note in this section.
