# System

  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Async_System.png)  
This event can only be triggered by a callback from a systemÂ level event
(such as the detection of a gamepad or the automatic signing in to XBox
Live) and it will return a [DS
Map](../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Data_Structures/DS_Maps/DS_Maps)
stored in the variable [ async_load
](../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Variables/Builtin_Global_Variables/async_load)
, containing different key/value pairs depending on the system level
event that triggered the call-back. These events are:

## Game Pads

When this event is triggered for a gamepad being connected or
disconnected it will return one of the following key/value pairs in the
async_load map:

-   " event_type " - the type of system event received, which will be
    one of the following strings:
    -    " gamepad discovered " - happens when the system reports a new
        gamepad has been connected
    -    " gamepad lost " - happens when the system has lost connection
        to a gamepad
-   " pad_index " - the index of the pad that has been added or removed

This event now permits you to move all your gamepad checking logic from
the Step Event or an Alarm event into the System Event and only run it
when it's actually required. **IMPORTANT!** This event will NOT be
triggered unless you have at least one [ gamepad\_\*
](../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Game_Input/GamePad_Input/Gamepad_Input)
function or [GML Visual
action](../../../Drag_And_Drop/Drag_And_Drop_Reference/Gamepad/Gamepad_Actions)
in your game code. The runner will only initialise the gamepad
sub-system when the functions are used in the project, so if they aren't
present, adding/removing gamepads will not trigger the System Event.

## Virtual Keyboards

When this event is triggered for a virtual keyboard being opened or
closed it will return the following key/value pairs in the async_load
map:

-   " event_type " - the type of system event received, which will be "
    virtual keyboard status " for virtual keyboards.
-   " screen_height " - the height of the virtual keyboard (in pixels).
    This will be 0 if the keyboard is invisible.
-   " keyboard_status " - the current status of the keyboard, returned
    as one of the following strings:
    -   "hiding"
    -   "hidden"
    -   "showing"
    -   "visible"

See
[here](../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Game_Input/Virtual_Keys_And_Keyboards/Virtual_Keys_And_Keyboards)
for more information on the virtual keyboard.

## Xbox Live

The asynchronous system event can be triggered when targeting the Xbox
One using the UWP export and checking the Enable Xbox Live option in the
[UWP Game Options](../../../Settings/Game_Options/Windows_UWP) .
When you start GameMaker UWP project that has Xbox Live enabled the
project will automatically try to silently sign-in to Xbox Live. The
results of this sign-in attempt will be returned as one of the following
key/value pairs in the async_load map:

-   " event_type " - the type of system event received, which will be
    one of the following strings:
-   " user signed in " - the silent user sign-in has been completed
    successfully
-   " user sign in failed " - the silent user sign-in has failed (when
    this happens you can use the function [
    xboxlive_show_account_picker()
    ](../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/UWP_And_XBox_Live/Users_And_Accounts/xboxlive_show_account_picker)
    to get the user to choose an account to sign in with)
-   " user signed out " - the user has signed out

Other functions for Xbox Live may also trigger this event, but the
different callbacks for those functions are detailed on the relevant
function pages. For more information on the specific functions available
for Xbox Live, please see
[here](../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/UWP_And_XBox_Live/UWP_And_XBox_Live)
.

## Audio System Status

This event type is specifically for use when working with the HTML5
target, as it will be triggered every time the Web Audio context status
changes. This means that if you have, for example, a piece of looping
background music, then you can pause it or stop and restart it, based on
this event triggering. This can be checked by looking for the following
key/value pair in the async_load map:

-   " event_type " - the type of system event received, which will be
    the string " audio_system_status " if the audio system has
    initialised or the context has changed.

If this event type is triggered, then there will be an additional key in
the async_load map:

-   " status " - The status of the audio system, which will be one of
    the following two strings
-   " available " - The audio system is initialised and available to
    play sounds
-   " unavailable " - The audio system is not initialised, or the
    context is not currently running, and so can't play sounds (all
    sound playing functions will return -1)

For more information on the specific functions available for Audio,
please see
[here](../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Audio/Audio)
. **NOTE** : While this event is designed for use with the HTML5 target,
it will also be triggered on all other platforms, but on everything
(except HTML5) it will only be triggered once on Game Start when the
audio engine is first initialised.
