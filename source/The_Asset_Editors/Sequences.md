# The Sequence Editor

  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Sequences.png)  
A **Sequence** is essentially a collection of assets that perform a
dynamic animation over time. They can contain sprites, instances, sounds
and other things, and each of these can be set to move or change colour,
or start/stop animating over time within the sequence itself. The assets
you add are assigned to specific **tracks** within the sequence and
these tracks can then have different attributes applied to them - called
**keyframes** - which can be static or change over time. All editing of
a sequence takes place in the **Sequence Editor** which is essentially
comprised of three areas:

-   **Canvas** - where you place the assets that make up the sequence
-   **Track Panel** - where you add/remove **asset tracks** and
    **parameter tracks** to your sequence
-   **Dope Sheet** - where you add/remove/edit the **keyframes** of the
    tracks and control how they behave over time.

Note too that you can have sequences within sequences to create complex
animations and effects, and sequences can also be accessed and changed
through code to give you as much control as possible over how they will
be displayed and used in your game. For more information on the coded
aspect of sequences, please see the section on the [Sequences
Functions](../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Sequences/Sequences)
. Before continuing to explain the details of the editor, we'll take a
moment to explain how a sequence is created as well as some keywords
that are used in the descriptions so you'll have a more thorough
understanding of how the Sequences Editor works. The general workflow
for creating a sequence is as follows:

-   First you'd create your sequence from the [Asset
    Browser](../Introduction/The_Asset_Browser) , which will open it
    the Sequences Editor.
-   Next you'd drag an asset (sprite, object, sound or sequence) into
    the editor canvas.
-   This will create an asset track in the **Track Panel** , and add an
    asset key to the Dope Sheet . The asset track is simply the name of
    the track that contains the asset, while the asset key is a bar that
    is drawn to symbolise the number of frames that the asset will be
    animated over in the sequence.
-   At this point, you'll usually want to position the asset in the
    canvas at its initial position for the start of the sequence, and
    add in any initial transforms, like scale or rotation.
-   When you are happy with the initial settings, you will want to
    record the **parameter keys** (or keyframe s ) - which is simply the
    name given to the values for scale, rotation and position that a
    specific asset key has at a any point in the dope sheet timeline.
-   Next you'd change the position of the playhead (the current play
    position in the dope sheet timeline) and then move or change the
    asset transforms and record another parameter key.
-   All parameter keys are stored in additional parameter tracks which
    are a subset of tracks under the main asset track in the Track
    Panel, and you can edit the parameter key data for each parameter in
    the track editor.
-   Now you would repeat the above process for the length of the
    sequence, moving, rotating and scaling the asset as required, and
    then adding more assets as you need them.

Below you can find an overview of each of the features of the sequence
editor, and at the bottom of this page are links to pages that explain
the three main features mentioned above in more depth: [ Rulers / Guides
Rulers / Guides ](#) The rulers along the edge of the canvas show you
the position of the things that are placed within it, and are marked
from (0, 0) which is the center of the canvas and the default origin for
the sequence. You can click and drag on the rulers to pull a horizontal
or vertical **guide** into the sequence, and this guide can then be used
to accurately position the different assets that are being used, as
moving an asset close to one will "snap" it to the guide. While
positioning assets within the sequence, **smart guides** will also be
temporarily shown indicating the distance between assets, as well as the
distance from the sequence boundary or center point.  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Sequences_Guides.png)  
Note that the boundary of the sequence and the center point marker lines
for the sequence are also considered guides and will behave the same way
as guides added from the rulers, with the exception that they cannot be
edited. The distance that assets "snap" to guides, as well as other
properties, can be set in the [Sequences
Preferences](../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/Sequences_Preferences)
. [ Canvas View Canvas View ](#) The canvas view is where you can see a
preview of the sequence canvas, and is where you can edit and position
the different assets that make up your sequence. You can add an asset to
the sequence by simply dragging it from the asset browser and then
dropping it into the canvas, and this will create a new track in the
Track Panel, and also add an asset key for the asset at the current
timeline playhead position. The following assets can be dropped onto the
canvas in this way:

-   [Sprites](Sprites)
-   [Objects](Objects)
-   [Sounds](Sounds)
-   [Sequences](Sequences)

You can also use the  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_TextButton.png)  
**Text** tool in the Toolbox to create a text track. Read [Text in
Sequences](Sequence_Properties/Text_in_Sequences) for more
information. Each asset added to the canvas can be manipulated in
multiple ways - rotated, transformed, or translated - based on how you
interact with it, as each asset will have a **bounding box** and
**transform gizmos** as well as **bounding box controls** . All this is
explained in more detail on the page about the [Sequence Editor
Canvas](Sequence_Properties/The_Sequence_Canvas) . NOTE Sound
assets, when added to a sequence, are essentially [sound
emitters](../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Audio/Audio_Emitters/Audio_Emitters)
that play only the given sound asset. To navigate around the canvas
view, you can use the same basic controls as for general Workspaces, ie:
Use the middle mouse button  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_MMB.png)  
and drag to pan the canvas (or alternatively use the  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Space.png)  
+  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png)  
combination), and you can scroll horizontally with the mouse wheel  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_MMB.png)  
or zoom in and out using the  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png)  
/  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png)  
key and the mouse wheel  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_MMB.png)  
. You can also cut, copy and paste assets using the  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png)

+Â " V " key combinations. [ Keyframe Controls Keyframe Controls ](#) The
keyframe control buttons are one of the ways that you can add, remove or
edit specific keys in the dope sheet. The buttons are as follows:

-     
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Seq_Split.png)  
    - This is the "Split selected keys" button. When you have selected
    one or more parameter keys in the dope sheet, you can then click
    this button and they will be split into two separate keys at the
    timeline playhead position (note that the keys must have been
    stretched to occupy multiple frames first):  
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Sequences_Split.gif)  
-     
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Seq_Delete.png)  
    - This is the "Delete selected keys" button. When you have selected
    one or more parameter keys in the dope sheet, you can then click
    this button and they will be deleted:  
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Sequences_Delete.gif)  
-     
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Seq_Add.png)  
    - This is the "Record a new key" button. When you have selected an
    asset key in the dope sheet and press this button, new parameter
    keys will be added to the asset track as parameter tracks, and the
    parameter keys will be added as points in the dope sheet timeline at
    the playhead position:  
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Sequences_Record.gif)  
-     
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Seq_Record.png)  
    - This is the "Automatically Record Changes" button. When this is
    enabled, any changes made to the asset within the canvas will be
    automatically recorded and the appropriate parameter tracks and
    parameter keys added at the playhead position in the dope sheet. For
    example, if you move the playhead from frame 0 to frame 10 and then
    in the canvas move the asset 100 pixels to the right, a parameter
    track will be added for position, and the parameter keys will be
    added at frame 0 (the initial position) and at frame 10 (the
    playhead position) and when you press "Play" on the sequence, the
    asset will move 100px to the right over ten frames.  
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Sequences_Auto.gif)  

[ Sequence Events Sequence Events ](#) In a similar way to regular
objects, sequences can have events that can run some code assigned to
them. The code is assigned in the form of a [scripted
function](../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Script_Functions) which
can take no arguments and will be called when the event is triggered.
Events are added by clicking the **Add Event** button  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_AddEvent.png)  
which will open the following window:  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Sequences_Events.png)  
The events listed here are as follows:

-   **Create** - This event happens when an instance of the sequence is
    first created, and is the very first thing that happens within a
    sequence placed in the room through the room editor when a room is
    entered.
-   **Destroy** - This event is executed when an instance of the
    sequence is destroyed, and will be run before the Clean Up event
    (see below).
-   **Clean Up** - This event will be called after any event that
    removes an instance of the sequence from the room. So, it will be
    triggered if the sequence is destroyed, if the room ends, or if the
    game ends, and is designed to perform any task that you need
    performed once when the sequence instance is removed from the game
    for any reason. If you have destroyed the sequence instance using,
    for example, layer_sequence_destroy(), then this event will be
    called after the Destroy Event (see above).
-   **Begin Step** / **Step** / **End Step** - The Step Event is an
    event that is checked every single step (frame) of the game while
    the sequence instance exists, and is split into three parts: begin,
    step and end. For most things the standard step event will be fine
    to use, but sometimes you want a bit more control over what code
    runs and at what time, so for that you are provided with the Begin
    and End step events, and these events will always be triggered in
    the same order every step (frame) of the game. **Important!** If the
    sequence is paused then these events will *not* be triggered, and
    when play resumes they will be triggered the *next frame after the
    sequence starts playing again* . Also note that the order of events
    is not influenced by the playhead direction, and even if the
    sequence is playing backwards, the events will still be run as
    Begin, Step and End.
-   **Async Event** : This is the equivalent of the object [Asynchronous
    System Event](Object_Properties/Async_Events) . **Important!**
    If the sequence is paused then this event will *not* be triggered.

Each event can be assigned a single function which will be called when
the event is triggered. You can assign the function using the input box
for the event, and clicking the arrow button Â will open the script
editor for the function to be edited. You can also click the Create New
button at the bottom to create a new script resource with "boilerplate"
functions already defined and ready to be filled in. Note that you can
change the function names to anything you require and do not have to use
the predefined names, and you can also remove any function definitions
that you don't need. It is important note that functions used for
sequence events cannot take any arguments. Sequence events can also be
added and edited using code. For more information please see
[here](../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Sequences/Sequence_Events_Moments_Broadcast)
. [ Track Panel Track Panel ](#) The **Track Panel** is where each of
the assets in your sequence is listed as a track, with each track having
sub-tracks for any parameters that are being changed for the asset. You
can click  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png)  
and drag on any asset track to change it's position above or below the
other tracks (any assigned parameter tracks will move along with it),
and you can use  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png)  
/  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png)  
+  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png)  
to select multiple tracks. You can create a track by dragging an asset
from the Asset Browser (either a sprite, an object, a sound or a
sequence) into the sequence canvas, or you can click the  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_AddAsset.png)  
icon at the bottom to add a new track and select the asset to use from
the Asset Explorer window that opens. The new track will be created and
the asset added at the current playhead position within the dope sheet
timeline:  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Sequences_AddTrack.gif)  
The track editor has many other features that are discussed in full
detail on the following page:

-   [The Track Panel](Sequence_Properties/The_Track_Panel)

[ Canvas Toolbox Canvas Toolbox ](#) The Sequence Editor toolbox
contains the different visualisation and setup options for the sequence
being edited.  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Sequences_Toolbox.png)  

-   **Add a Text Track**  
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_TextButton.png)  
    : This allows you to add a text track into the Sequence Canvas.
    After selecting this option, you can  
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png)  
    click (and optionally, drag) anywhere in the Canvas to create a new
    Text Track. For detailed information on text tracks, read: [Text in
    Sequences](Sequence_Properties/Text_in_Sequences) .
-   **Toggle Canvas Grid**  
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_CanvasGrid.png)  
    : This will toggle on/off the Sequence Editor canvas grid. This is a
    grid that GameMaker draws over the preview canvas to divide it into
    sections, and by default is set to 32x32px in size. If you click the
    Grid Menu icon  
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_CanvasOptions.png)  
    you will see the grid options:  
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Sequences_GridControls.png)  
    These options permit you to set the grid colour and alpha, as well
    as the cell values for the grid along the X and Y axis. You also
    have an option to enable or disable grid snapping here (disabled by
    default). You can use the keyboard shortcuts "G" and  
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Shift.png)  
    + "G" to toggle the grid visibility and grid snapping respectively.
-   **Canvas Zoom Controls**  
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_CanvasZoom.png)  
    : These buttons control the current canvas zoom level. You can zoom
    in or out and clicking the  
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_ZoomReset.png)  
    button will reset the canvas to be 1:1 with the sequence being
    edited. You can also click the Window Fit button  
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_CanvasFit.png)  
    to make the entire sequence canvas fit within the current editor
    workspace (this will zoom in/out as appropriate to make it fit).
    Note that you can also zoom in and out using the  
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png)  
    /  
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png)  
    and the Mouse Wheel  
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_MMB.png)  
    , and pressing  
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png)  
    /  
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png)  
    +  
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Enter.png)  
    will set the canvas to be 1:1 with the display.
-   **Toggle Gizmos**  
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_ToggleGizmos.png)  
    : Clicking this will enable or disable the different gizmos visible
    in the canvas. When enabled you will see all the gizmos associated
    with the different assets and the canvas itself, and when disabled
    these will not be shown, giving a clearer view of how the sequence
    looks. Note that this is enabled by default, and there is a menu
    available from the options button  
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_CanvasOptions.png)  
    where you canÂ filter what is visible without having to disable all
    the different widgets together. A complete list of these filter
    options and an explanation of what they do can be found
    [here](Sequence_Properties/The_Sequence_Canvas) .
-   T **oggle Transform Gizmo Mode**  
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_TransformWidget.png)  
    : Each asset added to a sequence has a transform gizmo at its
    origin:  
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Sequences_TransformWidget.gif)  
    This gizmo can control how the asset is scaled or rotated, as well
    as control its position and the position of the origin of the asset,
    however it only shows one of these options at a time. Clicking this
    button will switch between the different widget types or you can
    click on the options menu  
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_CanvasOptions.png)  
    to directly select the type of control action you want the transform
    gizmo to perform.
-   **Toggle Canvas Frame**  
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_ToggleCanvas.png)  
    : This button can be used to toggle the canvas frame on or off (it
    is on by default). The canvas frame is simply a guide that is used
    to judge where elements are placed in sequence canvas and any
    elements outside of the frame will not be rendered. This button also
    has the following options menu  
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_CanvasOptions.png)  
    :  
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Sequences_CanvasControls.png)  
    Here you can set the canvas frame toggle as well as the size of the
    canvas. You also have the possibility of setting a **reference
    image** , which is an image that you select from your computer (it
    is not imported into the project) to be used as a background
    reference for the sequence. This image is only visible in the
    Sequence Editor itself and will not be rendered when the sequence is
    used in a project. If you add a reference image you can also set the
    opacity that it's drawn at and offset its position within the canvas
    frame.

[ Sequence Tools Sequence Tools ](#) This bar has the various sequence
playback controls:  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Sequences_PlaybackControls.png)  

-   **Playback Speed** : this is the playback speed of the sequence in
    frames (steps) per second.
-   **Playhead Position** : this is the current playhead position, and
    can be shown in time (h:m:s) or frames (f).
-   **Time Display Options** : here you can set whether to display the
    sequence times in hours, minutes and seconds (h:m:s) or frames (f).
-   **Broadcast Message** : Clicking this permits you to add a
    **broadcast message** at the current playhead position (this is
    explained in more detail
    [here](Sequence_Properties/Broadcast_Messages) ).
-   **Add Moment** : Clicking this permits you to add a sequence
    **moment** at the current playhead position (this is explained in
    more detail below).
-   **Open Curve Editor** : This button toggles the currently selected
    track between the **curve view** and the **keyframe view** . This
    option is only really applicable to *parameter* tracks and when
    enabled you will then have further options available to you
    depending on whether the parameter track uses keyframes or an
    [animation curve](Animation_Curves) . For more information,
    please see the section on the [Using Animation
    Curves](Sequence_Properties/Using_Animation_Curves) .
-   **Playback Controls** : with these buttons you can start and stop
    the sequence preview, as well as move the playhead to the start or
    the end. There is also a button to set whether the sequence should
    loop or not, and whether the sequence should "ping-pong" or repeat
    when looping. Note that this setting *will* affect how the sequence
    is played when the projectÂ is compiled and run.
-   **Sequence Length** : this displays the total possible length of the
    sequence in frames (f) or in time (m:h:s). Note that the sequence
    may not run to this length if you have set the clip region to be
    smaller.

As mentioned above, you can add **Moments** to a sequence. A sequence
**moment** is a position on the timeline where the sequence can call a
**function** . This is a [scripted
function](../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Script_Functions) that
must have no parameters and when the moment (frame) on the timeline is
reached, this function will be called. To set a moment, you simply move
the playhead to the required position and then click the **Add Moment**
button, and in the dialog that opens you give the name of the function
to call.  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Sequences_AddMoment.gif)  
When adding a moment function, you can click the  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_GoTo_Function.png)  
button to go to the script with the specified function, or you can click
the  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_NewMomentFunction.png)  
button to create a new script resource with an empty function ready for
editing. You can also remove moment and the function call it contains by
clicking the  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RemoveMoment.png)  
button. Sequence moments can also be added and edited using code. For
more information please see
[here](../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Sequences/Sequence_Events_Moments_Broadcast)
.

[ Dopesheet Dopesheet ](#) The **Dope Sheet** is where all the asset key
and parameter key s for each track are shown. You can click  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png)  
and drag keys left or right to position them within the dope sheet
timeline, and you can also click  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png)  
on the right edge of an asset key to change its length. Note that for
sprites and objects, setting the length to be longer than the animation
will cause the animation to loop over the extra frames. The dope sheet
also has controls for setting the start and end of the clip region for
the sequence, and you can click  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png)  
anywhere to set the playhead to that position. For more information on
how to use the dope sheet, please see the following page:

-   [Using The Dope Sheet](Sequence_Properties/Using_The_Dope_Sheet)

[ Change Orientation Change Orientation ](#) The change orientation
button  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_ChangeOrientation.png)  
can be used to change the way the Sequence Editor displays the different
sections. By default you will have the Cnavas View at the top and the
Track Editor and Dopesheet at the bottom, but this can be changed by
clicking the button to cycle through the different layouts, or by
clicking the Options button  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_CanvasOptions.png)  
to open a menu and select the layout that you want. The following
layouts are available:

<table>

<td><strong>Split Window</strong></td>
<td>With this option the Sequence Editor will be split into two seperate
windows, where the main IDE window will show the Canvas view in the full
desktop and the new window will show the Dope Sheet and Track Editor.
Clicking the button again will change the layout again and remove the
extra window.</td>

You can also reset the Sequence Editor layout at any time by clicking
the Reset option  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Seq_Reset.png)  
. This will restore the editor to it's default state and re-open any
sections that had been closed. Due to the initial complexity of the
Sequence Editor, we have only given a brief overview of the features
available here, but we have additional pages listed below that go into
more depth about its features and how they can be used:

-   [The Sequence Canvas](Sequence_Properties/The_Sequence_Canvas)
-   [The Track Panel](Sequence_Properties/The_Track_Panel)
-   [Text in Sequences](Sequence_Properties/Text_in_Sequences)
-   [Clipping Masks](Sequence_Properties/Clipping_Masks)
-   [Using The Dope Sheet](Sequence_Properties/Using_The_Dope_Sheet)
-   [Using Animation
    Curves](Sequence_Properties/Using_Animation_Curves)
-   [Broadcast Messages](Sequence_Properties/Broadcast_Messages)
