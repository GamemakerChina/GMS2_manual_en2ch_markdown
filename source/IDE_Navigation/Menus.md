The top of the GameMaker IDE is occupied by the **Menu Bar** . Here you
can find a number of drop-down menus that can be used to navigate the
IDE, perform tasks or open additional windows with tools to help you
craft your games. Note that we list here the *default* menus that are
available, but some of the asset editors will add additional menus
depending on context. These additional menus are explained on the pages
relevant to the editor that created them. The default menus available
are:

-   [The File Menu](Menus/The_File_Menu)
-   [The Edit Menu](Menus/The_Edit_Menu)
-   [The Build Menu](Menus/The_Build_Menu)
-   [The Windows Menu](Menus/The_Windows_Menu)
-   [The Tools Menu](Menus/The_Tools_Menu)
-   [The Marketplace Menu](Menus/The_Marketplace_Menu)
-   [The Layouts Menu](Menus/The_Layouts_Menu)
-   [The Help Menu](Menus/The_Help_Menu)
