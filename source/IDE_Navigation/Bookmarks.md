# Bookmarks

Another method for navigating the workspace is to use **Bookmarks** .
You can add up to 9 "bookmarks" to IDE windows or sections of code/GML
Visual in scripts or object events, and then you can quickly skip
between them using the correct key combination. To add a bookmark,
simply select the window or line of code that you wish to tag and then

labeling the item in the IDE as follows:

In the image above we have assigned bookmarks numbered 1, 2, and 4 to
different parts of the IDE, and we can now navigate away from these
windows or even close them altogether, as the bookmark will permit us to
go straight back to it again at any time later. This is done by
pressing

+ **NumberKey** \[1 - 9\] , and if the bookmarked item has been closed
it will be opened, otherwise the workspace will pan to the selected
bookmark. IMPORTANT Bookmarks are not saved with the project or when the
IDE is closed. They are only valid for the session that they were
created in. If you want to remove a bookmark, you simply need to select
the bookmarked window or code line and then repeat the
