# The Windows Menu

  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/IDE_Input/Window_Menu.png)  
This menu is for opening the general docked IDE windows. Since docks can
be re-arranged and the contents can be removed as stand-alone windows or
even closed entirely, this window permits you to re-open them if you
find that you need them for anything. The windows that can be opened
from here are the [Asset
Browser](../../Introduction/The_Asset_Browser) window and all the
different [Output](../../Introduction/The_Output_Window) windows
(Output, Search, Source Control, Breakpoints and Compile/Syntax Errors).
Next you can open the [Inspector](../../IDE_Tools/The_Inspector)
window. This window is used to inspect the properties of the currently
selected IDE element, and these properties can then be edited as
required. After the Inspector option you have the [Recent
Windows](../Recent_Windows) list, and there is also the option to
open the **Environment Variables** window where you can see the
different paths that the various environment variables used in the
[Preferences](../../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences)
point to. These variables cannot be edited (neither their name nor their
path/setting) but you can select and copy/paste any of them for use
elsewhere.

Finally you have the option to open **Tutorial Windows** . This will
re-open any windows that are related to a tutorial project you have
opened, but only if the project is one that was created as part of a
tutorial (if not, this option will be unavailable). For information on
creating your own tutorial projects, please see the section on the
[Marketplace](../../Introduction/The_Marketplace) (as all tutorials
are created, hosted and downloaded from there).
