  The build menu is where you can choose to build your project either for testing, debugging or as a final executable. The available options are:
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Run
    </strong>
    - Run your current project on the chosen target platform for testing. For the different compile options available when compiling please see the section on
    <a href="../../Introduction/Compiling.htm">
     Compiling
    </a>
    . Note that this command is the same as pressing the Run button
    <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_PlayGame.png"/><br/>
    in the IDE.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Debug
    </strong>
    - Run your current project for testing with the debugger so that you can see detailed performance information and debug any errors or issues you may have. For more information on debugging, please see the section
    <a href="../../Introduction/Debugging.htm">
     Debugging
    </a>
    . Note that this command is the same as pressing the Debug button
    <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Debug.png"/><br/>
    in the IDE.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Clean
    </strong>
    -
    <span>
     GameMaker
    </span>
    keeps a
    <a>
     Cache
    </a>
    of files to help speed up compile time when testing. However sometimes a "stale" cache can lead to odd and unexpected errors in your game, in which case the first thing you should do is clean the cache from here and re-test. It is also a good idea to clean the cache before you create a final executable for the target platform. Note that this command is the same as pressing the
    <strong>
     Clean Cache
    </strong>
    button
    <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Clean.png"/><br/>
    in the IDE.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Create Executable
    </strong>
    - This will compile the current project and create an
    <a>
     executable package
    </a>
    (or packages) for the target platform. It will first open the file explorer so that you can select where you want to save the project and then compile the game. See the section on
    <a href="../../Introduction/Compiling.htm">
     Compiling
    </a>
    for more information on setting up the compile targets. Note that this command is the same as pressing the
    <strong>
     Create Executable
    </strong>
    button
    <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Compile.png"/><br/>
    in the IDE.
