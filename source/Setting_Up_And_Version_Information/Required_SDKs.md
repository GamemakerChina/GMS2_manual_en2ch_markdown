# Required SDKs

GameMaker itself has no special requirements other than those listed on
the [Installing](Installation_Guide) page and will install any
required dependencies the first time you install the product as part of
the package. However if you have any licence other than the *Free*
licence, then you will also be required to set up and maintain the SDK
's and other build tools that the export modules for the licence
require. You can find a complete list of the required tools and SDKs per
platform from the following link:
