  The
  <strong>
   Animation Curves Preferences
  </strong>
  are used to define certain properties for when you are working with the
  <a href="../../The_Asset_Editors/Animation_Curves.htm">
   Animation Curve Editor
  </a>
  . The options available are:
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Automatic response to curve deletion
    </strong>
    : This option can be used to control the pop up message that is shown when you delete a curve from the Animation Curve editor. The default action here is to show a warning message, but you can set
      this to "Okay" and the dialog will not be shown.
   </li>
  </ul>
