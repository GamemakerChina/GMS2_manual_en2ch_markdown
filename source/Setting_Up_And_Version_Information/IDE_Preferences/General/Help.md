# Help Preferences

  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Setup_And_Version/Preferences/General_Help_Prefs.png)  
The help manual is designed to operate like a web page and even though
the files may be stored locally (depending on your settings), it
requires the use of an external browser to view them. The following
settings related to the help manual can be changed here:

-   **Manual Language** : This sets the language of the manual. The
    default is "English".
-   **Use online manual:** Enable this to use the online [manual
    website](https://manual.yoyogames.com/#t=Content) whenever the
    manual is opened, or disable it to run the manual locally. This is
    disabled by default.
-   **Help manual port** : This sets the port number for the manual
    micro web server to use, if "Use online manual" is disabled. The
    default value is 51290.
