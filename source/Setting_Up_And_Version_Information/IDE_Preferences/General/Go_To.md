-   **Maximum number of search results to display** : This option
    controls the maximum number of returned results when you use the Go
    To search window.
-   **Enable styling on search results (turn off for better
    performance)** : This option enables or disables the text styling
    for the assets found in the Go To window, and is enabled by default.
    Disabling this should give better performance if you find the Go To
    search window to be slow on your system.
-   **Search In Assets** : This option allows the Go To window to search
    through the Asset Browser for any assets that match the search term,
    and is enabled by default.
-   **Search In Preferences** : This option allows the Go To window to
    search through the Preferences for any options that match the search
    term, and is enabled by default.
-   **Search in Redefine Keys** : This option allows the Go To window to
    search through the [Redefine Keys](../Redefine_Keys_Preferences)
    menu for any options that match the search term, and is enabled by
    default.
-   **Search In Game Options** : This option allows the Go To window to
    search through the Game Options for any options that match the
    search term, and is enabled by default.
-   **Search in user-defined Functions** : This option allows the Go To
    window to search through your scripts and objects for any functions
    that match the search term, and is enabled by default. Note that
    this only works with the [script
    function](../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Script_Functions)
    syntax ( function name() ) and not with the method variable syntax (
    name = function() ).
