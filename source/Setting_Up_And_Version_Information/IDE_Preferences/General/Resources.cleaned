  The preferences here contain options for how certain
  <strong>
   resources
  </strong>
  will be drawn in your projects:
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Initial default draw colour for new projects
    </strong>
    : When you use a font or draw a shape using the
    <span>
     GameMaker
    </span>
    functions or GML Visual actions without specifying a colour, the colour set here is the one that will be used. The default colour
      is white (
    <a>
     ARGB
    </a>
    : $FFFFFFFF).
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Initial default window colour for new projects
    </strong>
    : This option is used to set the HTML page background colour for the HTML5 target, as well as set the colour shown outside of rooms on all targets (including HTML5). The default colour
      is black (ARGB: $000000FF).
