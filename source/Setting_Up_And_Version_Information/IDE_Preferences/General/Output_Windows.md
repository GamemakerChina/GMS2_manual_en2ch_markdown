The [**Output Window**](../../../Introduction/The_Output_Window)
preferences control the different colour and formatting options for the
various different output windows in the IDE. Each of the different
windows has the same set of options, which are listed below:

-   **Colour** : The default colour for the text being written to the
    window.
-   **Font Name** : The name of the font to use (available fonts will
    depend on those installed on your system).
-   **Style** : The font style to use, like **bold** or *italics* (note
    that not all windows will permit the same styles and it will also
    depend on the font used).
-   **Size** : The size to set the font to for the given output window.
-   **Anti-Aliasing** : Here you can set the anti-aliasing mode for the
    output windows font rendering. You can choose to let the IDE decide
    by selecting *Use Default* , or you can force it *On* or *Off* by
    selecting either of those options.
