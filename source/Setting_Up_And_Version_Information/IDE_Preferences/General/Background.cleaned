  The
  <strong>
   Background
  </strong>
  preferences deal with the Workspace background and what it will display as well as how it will be displayed. The options are:
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Background Image
    </strong>
    : This is the image file that will be used as the background for the different Workspaces. There is a default image supplied and it is enabled by default, but you can select your own image here. The types of image
      that you can select from are
    <span>
     *.png
    </span>
    ,
    <span>
     *.gif
    </span>
    ,
    <span>
     *.jpg
    </span>
    ,
    <span>
     *.jpeg
    </span>
    ,
    <span>
     *.tif
    </span>
    ,
    <span>
     *.tiff
    </span>
    ,
    <span>
     *.ico
    </span>
    ,
    <span>
     *.bmp
    </span>
    ,
    <span>
     *.2bp
    </span>
    or
    <span>
     *.mdi
    </span>
    , but note that regardless of initial image format, all files will be saved out for use as
    <span>
     *.png
    </span>
    files,
        so animated
    <span>
     *.gif
    </span>
    files for example will only be rendered as a single initial frame.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Image Scaling
    </strong>
    : This controls how the background image will be scaled within the different workspaces. The choices are:
    <ul>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Stretch
      </strong>
      - The image will be stretched to fit the workspace, changing scale depending on the visible docks
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Tile
      </strong>
      - The image will be tiled to cover the workspace
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Best Fit
      </strong>
      - The image will be scaled to fit the workspace proportionally, with bars being added around the edge if it is not a 1:1 fit
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Desktop Stretch
      </strong>
      - The background will cover the whole workspace, and will move rather than change scale when docks are opened/closed
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Screen Stretch
      </strong>
      - The background will cover an area the size of the window and will be cropped/extended to show more or less of the image as docks are opened/closed.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Show background images on workspaces
    </strong>
    : This option controls whether the selected background image should be shown or not. By default this is checked as on.
   </li>
  </ul>
