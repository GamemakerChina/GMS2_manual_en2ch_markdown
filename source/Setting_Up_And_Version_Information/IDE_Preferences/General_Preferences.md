# General Preferences

  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Setup_And_Version/Preferences/General_Prefs.png)  
The **General Preferences** are used to define the general behaviour of
the GameMaker IDE . The most general ones are listed on the main page
while many others are split into multiple sub-categories, explained
further down this page.

-   **IDE Language** : This option permits you to select the language
    for the IDE from the list of options supplied. Default is English.
-   **IDE Skin** : Here you can select from the different skins that the
    IDE can use. By default GameMaker comes with two skins, one light
    and one dark, and the initial setup uses the dark skin.
-   **Maximum Framerate of GameMaker Editor** : This option permits you
    to set the maximum framerate that the GameMaker IDE will update at,
    permitting you to set the framerate to match the update speed of
    your monitor. Default value is 60.
-   **Default Audio Device** : Here you can choose the default audio
    device for the GameMaker IDE to use. You can refresh the list by
    clicking the Refresh Button

    .
-   **Automatic Response to Exit Confirmation** : This option permits
    you to set whether a confirmation message should be shown when you
    exit GameMaker . By default this is set to "show message", but can
    be set to skip the message as if you'd clicked OK.
-   **Automatic Response to The System Font Changed Dialog** : This
    option permits you to set whether a confirmation message should be
    shown when a system font has been added, removed or edited. By
    default this is set to "show message", but can be set to skip the
    message as if you'd clicked OK.
-   **Enable notifications** : Checking this will enable the IDE to show
    notifications about new runtimes, etc... This is on by default.
-   **Notification timeout (ms)** : This sets the length of time (in
    milliseconds) that a notification is shown for. Default is 6000.
-   **Logout on exit** : If this option is checked then the IDE will
    automatically log out the user session when GameMaker is closed.
    This is primarily aimed at Education users, as - when checked - this
    means that whenever the program shuts down the user would be logged
    out and so free up the session seat for other users to use. This is
    off by default.
-   **Enable DPI Override** : This option lets you override the default
    DPI setting with your own. You must first enable the option and then
    set either the **Raw DPi Override** value (the default value is 96)
    or set the **Percentage of the native DPi** (default value 100%),
    and once changed you will be prompted to restart the IDE, which may
    require you to save any work being done on the currently open
    project. Note that the DPi has a minimum percentage of 50% and a
    maximum of 500%, and if you you mouse over the information icon you
    can see the recommended maximum setting for the display being
    used:

    Note that if you go above the recommended DPi setting for the
    monitor, you will be shown a notification that permits you to reset
    the DPi.
-   **Show welcome screen on startup** : This is on by default and
    simply tells GameMaker to show a brief splash screen when you start
    the program. Un-checking this will prevent the splash screen from
    showing.
-   **Allow empty tabs to close via shortcut** : You can close any open
    Tabs using the keyboard shortcut  
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png)  
    /  
    ![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png)  
    + **W** , but if you disable this option that shortcut will no
    longer work. This is enabled by default.
-   **Open new resources for edit on dragging files into IDE** : Certain
    resources (like sprites or sounds) can be dragged onto the main
    Workspace in the GameMaker IDE and will be detected and added as a
    new resource in the Asset Browser. By default the corresponding
    resource editor will also be opened for editing when this happens,
    but un-checking this option will prevent the editors from being
    opened and you will be required to open them manually.
-   **Open new resources for edit on creation** : If this is checked,
    every time you create a new resource in the Asset Browser, the
    corresponding resource editor will be opened automatically. This is
    checked by default and un-checking it will mean that you have to
    manually open all newly created resources.
-   **Automatically reload changed files** : If this is checked then the
    IDE will automatically scan and check files to see if any of them
    have been changed outside of GameMaker and reload them if they have.
-   **Disable IDE transition animations** : The GameMaker IDE has a
    number of animated transitions for things like opening windows
    etc... however they are not to everyone's taste and you may
    experience a performance boost if they are disabled on older or
    under-powered machines if they are disabled. You can disable them
    here, and they are on by default.
-   **Opt-in To Feedback Surveys** : When this option is checked, you
    are telling GameMaker that you wish to participate in feedback
    surveys, meaning that occasionally while working a message will be
    shown about the area you are working on and request a rating and
    feedback. This option is on by default.
