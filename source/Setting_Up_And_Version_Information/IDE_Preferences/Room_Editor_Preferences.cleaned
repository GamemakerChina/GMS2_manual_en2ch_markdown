  The
  <strong>
   Room Editor Preferences
  </strong>
  are used to define how the
  <a href="../../The_Asset_Editors/Rooms.htm">
   Room Editor
  </a>
  will look and behave. The general settings are as follows:
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Chain fade out start distance (px)
    </strong>
    : Sets the distance from the parent window for the chain link to fade out from. Default is 10px.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Chain fade out stop distance (px)
    </strong>
    : Sets the distance from the parent window for the chain link to end fading out to. Default is 100px.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Chain Minimum Alpha
    </strong>
    : Sets the final alpha value after the fade out falloff point for the chain alpha. Default is 0.3.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Default layer depth spacing
    </strong>
    : When you create multiple layers in the room editor they are automatically assigned a depth based on their position within the layer list. This depth is incremented by the amount given here. The default
      value is 100, so each layer will be previous layer + 100 in depth.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Default room width
    </strong>
    : Sets the initial width that will be selected as the default for a new room. Default is 1024px.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Default room height
    </strong>
    : Sets the initial height that will be selected as the default for a new room. Default is 768px.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Add default room layers
    </strong>
    : When you create any new room resource,
    <span>
     GameMaker
    </span>
    will generate a couple of "base" layers for you - a background layer and an instance layer. You can switch that behaviour off here so that
      new rooms will have no pre-made layers. This is on by default.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Show room views
    </strong>
    : If you have views active within a room, this is shown by an outline where the view boundaries would be within the room, and the visibility of this area can be toggled using the dedicated button in the editor itself.
      However you can choose to have view boundaries invisible when you open a room by un-checking this option (the button can still be used to show them again). The default value is on, making view boundaries visible when you open a room.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     General colour options
    </strong>
    : These are related to the different colours that are used throughout the room editor interface, and if you double click on any of the swatches you can edit the colour for that setting.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Master-volume setting
    </strong>
    : The master volume setting for preview playback in the Room Editor, a value between 0 and 1. Default is 1.
   </li>
  </ul>
  Further options are available for editing from the sub-categories listed below:

  <strong>
  </strong>
  The
  <strong>
   Confirm Dialogs
  </strong>
  preferences are used to change the messages that are shown in the room editor when you perform certain actions. The messages you can change are:
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Automatic response to updating layer depths
    </strong>
    : hen you change layer depths a message is shown to warn you that doing this will also automatically update all the other layer depths. With this option you can choose to have the message
        show, have it update the layers as if you'd clicked "Ok", or have it not update anything as if you'd clicked "No".
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Automatic response to layer locked warning
    </strong>
    : If you try to delete a layer in the room and it happens to be locked, you will be shown a message by default. However setting this option to "Ok" will not show the message and
        just not let you delete the layer.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Automatic response to item locked warning
    </strong>
    :

        just not let you delete the item.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Automatic response to item owner layer locked warning
    </strong>
    : If you try to delete an item on a layer and the layer happens to be locked (even if the item is not), then you will be shown a message by default to inform you that it can't
        be done. However setting this option to "Ok" will not show the message and just not let you delete the item.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Create new asset layer when dragging sequences/sprites onto unsuitable layers
    </strong>
    : If you try to add a sprite (or a sequence) to a layer that is not an asset layer, then you will be shown a message by default to inform you that it can't
        be done and ask if you want to create a new asset layer for the item being dragged. However setting this option to "Ok" will not show the message and automatically create a new layer for sprites (and sequences).
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Automatic response to parent room item deletion
    </strong>
    : Here you can choose what happens when you delete an item that is part of a parent room (and so present in all child rooms). The default is to show you a warning message and let you
        decide what to do, but you can set it to "Delete All" to suppress the message and go ahead with the item delete from the parent room and all its children, or you can select "Keep All" to suppress the message abort the delete.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Automatic response to parent room layer deletion

        decide what to do, but you can set it to "Delete All" to suppress the message and go ahead with the layer delete from the parent room and all its children, or you can select "Keep All" to suppress the message abort the delete.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Automatic response to invalid asset drag error
    </strong>
    : If you try to add an asset to a layer that is not designated as being for that asset type (like adding a path to an instance layer), then you will be shown a message by default to
        inform you that it can't be done. However setting this option to "Ok" will not show the message and just not let you add the asset. Note that this option does not apply to instances, sprites or sequences.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Create new instance layer when dragging objects onto unsuitable layers
    </strong>
    : If you try to add an object instance to a layer that is not an instance layer, then you will be shown a message by default to inform you that it can't be
        done and ask if you want to create a new instance layer for the item being dragged. However setting this option to "Ok" will not show the message and automatically create a new layer for the instance.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Automatic response to invalid layer selection drag error
    </strong>
    : Here you can choose what happens when you drag a resource onto the room editor when you have selected multiple layers in the layer editor (or have not selected any layer
        at all). The default is to show a warning message but you can set this option to "OK" to suppress the message and continue, without adding any resources.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Automatic response to locked or invisible layer drag error
    </strong>

        can set this option to "OK" to suppress the message and continue, without adding any resources.
