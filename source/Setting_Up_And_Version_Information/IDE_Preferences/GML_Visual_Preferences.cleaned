    <strong>
     <span>
      GML Visual
     </span>
    </strong>
    event or script into GML code, you will by default get a message warning you about what you are about to do and asking if you want to continue. Setting this option to "OK" will simply okay the change without showing the message.

    <strong>
     <span>
      GML Visual
     </span>
    </strong>
    icons. This setting will be used to define the maximum permitted size (default 64px).

    code block (default 3px).
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Mouse down time to start dragging nodes (ms)
    </strong>
    : When you click on a node and drag it, you will be re-positioning the node within the action code. However if you hold the mouse down for a moment and then move, you will be moving the node position within the workspace but not within the order of the code. This setting sets the number of milliseconds to have to wait with the mouse button pressed before the node can be moved (not re positioned). Default is 350.
