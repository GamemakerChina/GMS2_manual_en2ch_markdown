The **Tile Set Editor Preferences** has the following option for Auto
Tiling: **Auto tile background colour** : This option sets the
background colour within the tile set editor in the section for creating
Auto Tiles. The default colour is (rgba) \#808080FF. The Tile Set Editor
preferences also has a **Confirm Dialogs** sub-section:

The option available here controls the message that pops up when you
change the cell size of the tile set and this will affect how the room
tilemap layers are rendered (resulting in cropped layers). By default
you will be prompted to continue or cancel the operation, and this
option lets you suppress this message by selecting "Okay" which will go
ahead with the tile set cell change regardless of the impact on room
tilemap layers. Default value is "Show Message".
