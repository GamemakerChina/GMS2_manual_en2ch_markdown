This section deals with the preferences that are requiredÂ to get the
[Git SCM](../../IDE_Tools/Source_Control) plugin to work with

    which GameMaker uses for all Source Control commands. As shown in
    the image above, this will be located in the cmd folder of your Git
    installation.

Below this you can set up the *Merge Tool* and the *Diff Tool* for
Source Control with these settings ( **optional** ):

-   **Merge (Tool location)** : Here you specify the full file path to
    the Git merge tool.

    commands to be run whenever you use the merge Tool.
-   ****Diff (Tool location)**** : Here you specify the full file path
    to the Git diff tool.
