# Animation Curve Editor Preferences

  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Setup_And_Version/Preferences/AnimCurve_Prefs.png)  
The **Animation Curves Preferences** are used to define certain
properties for when you are working with the [Animation Curve
Editor](../../The_Asset_Editors/Animation_Curves) . The options
available are:

-   **Automatic response to curve deletion** : This option can be used
    to control the pop up message that is shown when you delete a curve
    from the Animation Curve editor. The default action here is to show
    a warning message, but you can set this to "Okay" and the dialog
    will not be shown.
