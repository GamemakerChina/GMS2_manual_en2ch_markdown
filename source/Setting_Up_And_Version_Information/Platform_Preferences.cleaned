  This section of the manual covers the different platform specific
  <strong>
   Preferences
  </strong>
  that need to be set up before you can compile your games to certain targets. These generally only need set up once to start with (although future updates to the
  <a href="IDE_Preferences/Runtime_Feed_Preferences.htm">
   runtimes
  </a>
  may require you to change certain things, but these will be mentioned in the
  <a href="Release_Notes.htm">
   Release Notes
  </a>
  ) and are use to point to any
  <a>
   SDK

  s that are required and set basic

   The manual does not show the various
  <strong>
   Console
  </strong>
  preferences (Xbox, PlayStation and Nintendo Switch) due to the different legal restrictions maintained by the different companies. If you have a Console Licence, then you can get this information form the
