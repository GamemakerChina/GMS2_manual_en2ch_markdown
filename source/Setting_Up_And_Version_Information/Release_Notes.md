# Release Notes

Each release of GameMaker comes with it's own set of release notes.
These contain detailed information on the changes that have been made as
well as a complete list of all the bugs that have been fixed. This is an
invaluable tool for deciding whether to update your current version, or
when you find something that may be a bug after a release. The release
notes are split into two different sets due to the fact that both the
IDE and the actual Runtimes can be updated independently. You can find
the current release notes for the IDE from the link below:
