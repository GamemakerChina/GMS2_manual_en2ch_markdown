  <h2>
   YoYo Account
  </h2>
  Your licence is tied to a
  <strong>
   YoYo Account
  </strong>
  (YYA) and you are required to have made one to be able to use
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  . This account holds all your licence details for the YoYo Games products that you own, and is also used for the
  <a href="../Introduction/The_Marketplace.htm">

    IMPORTANT
   </strong>
  </span>
  After purchasing any new licence for
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  we recommend that you
  <strong>
   log out of the IDE and then restart
   <span>
    GameMaker
   </span>
  </strong>
  <strong>
   and log back in again
  </strong>
  to make sure that the new licence is applied correctly. You can log out from the
  <a href="../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_File_Menu.htm">
   File Menu
  </a>
  .
  <h1>
   Proxy Support
  </h1>
  If you require Proxy Support for your installation of
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  , this can be added simply by clicking the
  <strong>
   Proxy
  </strong>
  . This will bring up the following window:
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Setup_And_Version/Getting_Started_Proxy.png"/><br/>
  You can now add in your proxy details. Some of the fields shown above are optional and if there is one you don't require then simply leave the field blank. Before continuing however it is worth noting that if you have set a proxy in your
  <a href="https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/4-ways-to-open-internet-options-in-windows-10.html">
   Windows Internet Options
  </a>
  , and it doesn't require a username/password, then it should just "as is" and you probably will not be required to set up the proxy in
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  .
  
  
   If your proxy does require a username and/or password, then you'll need to add them in to the fields shown in the window above. Note that in these cases the username/password/proxy details will always be required, and that the proxy IP should also have the port added, ie:
  <span>
   xx.xx.xx.xx:port
  </span>
  .
  
  
   Once you have added the relevant information, click on Okay and log in to
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  as normal.
