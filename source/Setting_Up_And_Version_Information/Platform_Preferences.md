# Platform Preferences

This section of the manual covers the different platform specific
**Preferences** that need to be set up before you can compile your games
to certain targets. These generally only need set up once to start with
(although future updates to the
[runtimes](IDE_Preferences/Runtime_Feed_Preferences) may require you
to change certain things, but these will be mentioned in the [Release
Notes](Release_Notes) ) and are use to point to any SDK s that are
required and set basic Compiling options for how you want GameMaker to
compile your game projects for any given platform. Note that the
platforms available will depend on the
[Licence](GMS2_Version_Information) that you have and not all of
them may be available. Below is a list of all the available target
platforms for standard licences:

-   [Android](Platform_Preferences/Android)
-   [HTML5](Platform_Preferences/HTML5)
-   [Opera GX](Platform_Preferences/Opera_GX_Preferences)
-   [iOS](Platform_Preferences/iOS)
-   [tvOS](Platform_Preferences/tvOS)
-   [macOS](Platform_Preferences/macOS)
-   [Windows](Platform_Preferences/Windows)
-   [Windows UWP](Platform_Preferences/Windows_UWP)

Note that apart from setting up these preferences, you will also need to
set up the devices that some of these platforms target, otherwise you
may not be able to compile nor test your projects. See the section on
[Compiling](../Introduction/Compiling) and the section on the
[Device Manager](The_Device_Manager) for more information. The
manual does not show the various **Console** preferences (Xbox,
PlayStation and Nintendo Switch) due to the different legal restrictions
maintained by the different companies. If you have a Console Licence,
then you can get this information form the [YoYo Games
Helpdesk](https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/categories/202590248-Console-Support)
, but you must first contact YoYo Games with your console ID email and
request permission to view the different sections.
