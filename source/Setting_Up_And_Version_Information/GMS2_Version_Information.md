# Licencing & Version Information

There are various different versions of the licences that you can get
for GameMaker , the choice of which will depend largely on the audience
that you want to target as well as on whether you just want to have some
fun making games or wish to sell and distribute them as well. For
up-to-date information on GameMaker licences, please see the following

Regardless of the version of GameMaker that you use, they will all
require same basic setup before use. The sections listed below all deal
with this, and include information on updating the IDE and Runtimes, the
required SDKs for specific target modules, and the IDE Preferences to
adapt how GameMaker works to suit your own style of doing things.
