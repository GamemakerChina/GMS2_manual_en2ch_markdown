# IDE Error Reporting

While great care has been taken when creating GameMaker to ensure that
it is a stable and reliable tool, there is always the possibility that
an issue could occur given the nature of the software and the operating
systems it runs on. In most cases any errors will be caught by GameMaker
and you may be prompted to save your projects and then close and restart
the program. If this happens then we would request that you file a bug
with the YoYo Games helpdesk. You can do this using the **Report A Bug**
option from the [Help Menu](../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_Help_Menu)
and, we ask that when doing so you give as much information as possible
and also supply a link to the GameMaker ui.log file, which can be found
in the following locations, depending on the OS:

-   On Windows - C:\ProgramData\GameMaker
-    O n macOS - /Users/Shared/GameMaker/ (Macintosh HD \> Users \>
    Shared \> GameMaker)

On very rare occasions, if the error is severe, then the product may
crash without giving the above mentioned warning, and if this happens
then you will be shown the following window:  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Setup_And_Version/Getting_Started_Crash_Report.png)  
This window will show you some of the crash report data that has been
compiled by GameMaker and gives you the option to send it to YoYo Games
so they can see what happened and fix the issue if possible in future
updates. If you'd like to know exactly what data is being sent, then
please see [this
article](https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028120992) on
the YoYo Games Helpdesk.
