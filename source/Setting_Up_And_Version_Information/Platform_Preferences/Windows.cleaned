   Windows Preferences
  </h1>
  The Windows preferences have the following options:

  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Visual Studio location:
    </strong>
    This option is for pointing
    <span>
     GameMaker
    </span>
    to the Microsoft Visual Studio installation on the build PC.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Default packaging type
    </strong>
    : When building a final Windows executable package, you can choose between creating either an installer (using
    <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/">
     NSIS
    </a>
    ) or a compressed
    <span>
     ZIP
    </span>
    file
      that will have the game and any additional files within it. By default you will be shown a dialog to choose between these two options on compile, but you can set this preference to always use one or the other. Note that when this option is set to
    <em>
     Show Dialog
    </em>
    , in the actual dialog window that pops up on compile, enabling "Remember Packaging Option" will set this preference to the option you select.
