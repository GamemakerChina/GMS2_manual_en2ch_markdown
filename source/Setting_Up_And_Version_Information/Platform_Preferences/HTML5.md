# HTML5 Preferences

The HTML5 preferences have the following options:  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Setup_And_Version/Platform_Preferences/HTML5_Prefs.png)  

-   **Default packaging type** : When building a final HTML5 executable
    package, you can choose between **Package as loose files** - which
    will simply generate all the required files in a folder - or
    **Package as Zip** - which will create a compressed ZIP file that
    will have the game and any additional files within. By default you
    will be given a choice of which of these two options you wish to
    choose on compile, but you can set this preference to always use one
    or the other. Note that when this option is set to *Show Dialogue* ,
    in the actual dialogue window that pops up on compile, choosing
    "Remember Packaging Option" will set this preference to the option
    you select.
-   **Default Web Server Port** : This lets you change the default port
    for the HTML5 web server. Default value is 51264.
-   **Default Web Server Address** : Here you can change the default web
    server address for the HTML5 web server. Default value is 127.0.0.1.
-   **Default Web Server Allowed IPs** : Here you can add in any allowed
    IPs for the web server and they will be set as default for all
    devices added through the Target Manager.

IMPORTANT When using a particular target device (i.e. browser), the IP
and port values set for that particular device are used instead of these
preferences. Check [The Device Manager](../The_Device_Manager#h) to
see a list of your devices with their details.
