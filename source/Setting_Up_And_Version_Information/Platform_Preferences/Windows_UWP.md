    to the UWP tools installation path on the build PC.
-   **Default package architecture** : By default, you are shown a
    dialog window to choose between the **x86** , **x64** and **ARM**
    architectures when compiling a UWP executable. You can set this
    option to one of those three which will then be selected by default
    whenever you choose to compile an executable.
-   **Automatic response to creating store package** : In the dialog
    window shown on compile, you can choose to create a store package.
    You can set this option to either **Yes** or **No** which will be
    used by default whenever you choose to compile an executable.
