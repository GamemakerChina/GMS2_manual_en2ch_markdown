Welcome to the GameMaker user manual! This document is divided into
three parts with the aim of getting you introduced to the interface and
basic workings of GameMaker and general programming, before going on to
more advanced usage and the functions available through our proprietary
programming language GML (GameMaker Language). To ease you into things
we have created a handy Quick Start Guide, and even if you are familiar
with other game creation tools we recommend that you start there to get
an overview of the way that GameMaker works. You'll find GameMaker to be
easy and intuitive to use and that, whatever your skill level, you will
soon be making those games you've always dreamed of. **NOTE** Due to the
modular nature of GameMaker there are certain things that are not
included in this user manual, in particular those aspects of setting up
and connecting the different devices that can be supported. For
up-to-date information and troubleshooting hints and tips related to the
different target platforms, please see the [YoYo Games Help
Center](https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us) .

# Getting Started

This section is the obligatory first stop for using GameMaker and
getting to grips with the contents of the IDE and how it works. You'll
find that GameMaker is intuitive and simple to use, and even if you've
never used any tools like this before you shouldn't have any problems
getting started and making games after reading through the
**Introduction** and completing the **Quick Start Guide** (below). Once
you have got to grips with the basics you can then move on to the more
in-depth look at the components of GameMaker in the **IDE** sections
below. [ Introduction to GameMaker Introduction to GameMaker
