  <h1>
   Watches
  </h1>
  The whole idea of the Debugger is to permit you to "watch" every detail of your game. This is done using "watch windows" which, by default, are opened in the
  <a href="../../Introduction/The_Output_Window.htm">
   Output window
  </a>
  docked
    at the bottom of the IDE. You can click on each of the different tabs to see the watches that they contain, some of which can be made to update in real time (when real time debugging
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Debug_RealTime.png"/><br/>
  is enabled from the Debugger toolbar) while others will require the debugger to have paused the game.
  
  
   When you are watching
  <strong>
   variables
  </strong>
  in any of the windows, it can be one of multiple
  <strong>
   data-types
  </strong>
  . However, due to the way that
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  stores certain things, the Debugger does not always know exactly what the
    variable holds. This is because the internal ID values for data structures or instances are
  <em>
   integers
  </em>
  and so the Debugger doesn't always know if the integer value being stored in a variable is for a data structure or an instance or is
    simply an integer value. For that reason, you can right click
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png"/><br/>
  on any variable value and get a pop-up window that lists the available data-types
    that this variable could be:
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/IDE%20Tools/Debug_DataTypes.png"/><br/>
  Strings and arrays do not permit this option, and it is worth noting that even if a data structure is stored in an instance variable, its ID number
    is global, so if you have four instances and each one creates a ds_list (for example), each list will have an ID from 0 to 3, and they won't all be 0.
  
  
   Once you have selected your data-type, the variable will then show the entries in the structure simply by clicking the small
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Debug_Expand.png"/><br/>
  next to its name. This will expand the structures
    contents, and you can also change some of the values for the variables shown by simply double clicking
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"/><br/>
  on the value and giving it a new one.
  <strong>
   NOTE
  </strong>
  : you cannot re-assign arrays or data structures in this way, but you can change some of their contents (you cannot change the "key" values in maps, nor the priority value for priority queues).
  
  
   Below you can find a list of each of the different watch windows along with an explanation of what they are for and how to use them:
  <a href="#">
   <span>
    Locals
   </span>
   <span>
    Locals
   </span>
  </a>
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/IDE%20Tools/Debug_Local_Window.png"/><br/>
  The
  <strong>
   Locals
  </strong>
  window shows the current step properties, which includes the name of the current event (or script) being
      run, the offset in the
  <a>
   Virtual Machine (VM)
  </a>
  code for the current script (the acronym "PC" is for "program counter"), the "self" instance running
      the code block, and the "other" instance in the event. This last part is only ever valid when the event is a
  <em>
   collision
  </em>
  event or there is a "
  <span>
   with
  </span>
  " used in the code. If the instance is in collision,
      "other" will show the other instance (and its variables) in the collision, but if it is a
  <span>
   with
  </span>
  then the "Self" instance becomes that which is running the code, while "Other" is then the instance
      that actually contains the
  <span>
   with
  </span>
  . At all other times, "other" will simply show the same data as "Self".
   
   
    Note that the "Self" and "Other" instances can be expanded by clicking on
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Debug_Expand.png"/><br/>
  to see a
      list of all local and instance variables that are currently declared for the code block being stepped through. If you right click
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png"/><br/>
  on a value you can set its
  <strong>

  The
  <strong>
   Globals
  </strong>
  window will show a list of
      all the currently declared
  <strong>
   global
  </strong>
  variables and their values. If you right click
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png"/><br/>

  This window is for you to add a specific variable that
      you want to keep track of. This can be a
  <strong>
   global
  </strong>
  or
  <strong>
   instance
  </strong>
  scope variable, a
  <strong>
   built in
  </strong>
  variable or even an
  <strong>
   array
  </strong>
  or
  <strong>
   data structure
  </strong>
  . If the the instance code being
      stepped through has the watched variable it will be shown here, meaning you can easily keep track of a value without having to search for it in the
  <strong>
   Locals
  </strong>
  or
  <strong>
   Globals
  </strong>
  windows. If you right click
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png"/><br/>
  on a value you can set its
  <strong>

  As the name implies, this window will show all
  <strong>
   instance
  </strong>
  variables,
  <strong>
   local
  </strong>
  variables for the instance event,
  <strong>
   built in
  </strong>
  variables, and
  <strong>
   structs
  </strong>
  associated with the instance currently being stepped through in the Source window (if an instance is being referenced using
      the keyword "other" or the
  <span>
   with
  </span>
  statement, then this window will show that instances properties instead). If you right click
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png"/><br/>
  on a value you can set its
  <strong>

  Should you need to see all instances that
      are currently in the room, you can select this window and they will be listed. You can also see the state of any
  <strong>
   built in
  </strong>
  variables,
  <strong>
   instance
  </strong>
  variables or
  <strong>
   structs
  </strong>
  that they have, and you can right
      click
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png"/><br/>
  on a value to set its

  This window is for when
      you select an instance from your game. This is done by simply pausing the game and then clicking on any visible instance within the game window. The instance found beneath the mouse cursor will then have its information displayed in the Selected
      Instance window, where you can see it's built in variables, instance variables, and structs the same as for the Instances window.

  This watch shows you all the information available
      for the state of the current frame being
  <a>
   rendered
  </a>
  , like the draw alpha or fill colour. This cannot be updated in real time so you will need to pause the game to update and get the frame
      details.

  This watch enables you to see
      exactly what is being drawn to any
  <strong>
   surfaces
  </strong>
  you have in your game (including the application surface) as well as see the
  <a>
   texture page
  </a>
  <span>
   s
  </span>
  that are in memory. You can select from textures or surfaces from the menu at the bottom of the watch, and then mouse over the texture or surface ID to have it displayed in a pop-up window:
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/IDE%20Tools/Debug_Textures.png"/><br/>
  Note that the debugger must be
  <strong>
   paused
  </strong>
  before these will update.

  This window is where you can see the current system
  <strong>
   profile
  </strong>
  for the game being tested and it's where you can check everything in your game from whole events to individual function calls to see how they are performing and spot
      any trouble areas or bottlenecks. For further information on profiling see the following page:

    Buffer
   </span>
  </a>
  If you have initialised any buffers in your game, then this window will show you the
  <strong>
   buffer data
  </strong>
  . You can select any buffer created by setting the
  <strong>
   Buffer ID
  </strong>
  value, which will start at 0 for the first buffer created
      in your game, and increment by 1 for each consecutive buffer:
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/IDE%20Tools/Debug_Buffer.png"/><br/>
  If you right click
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png"/><br/>
  on the data window or click the
  <strong>
   Data Display
  </strong>
  button, you can select how the data is displayed, setting the
  <em>
   alignment
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   type
  </em>
  , and you can also set how
      the data is laid out from the
  <strong>
   Column Select
  </strong>
  box. There is a drop-down window here where you can select from a default list of layouts.
