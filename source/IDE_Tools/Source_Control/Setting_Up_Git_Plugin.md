# Setting Up The Git Plugin

Before we canÂ use the Git plugin, we need to set up the Git executable
to use by going into the [Plugins - Source Control
(Git)](../../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/Plugin_Preferences)
section of the
[Preferences](../../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences)
:

The Git executable path should be auto-filled if it's found by
GameMaker, however if the field is empty, you can click on the

button and manually select the git.exe file included in cmd folder of
your Git installation, which is usually inside C:\Program Files\Git\\ .
For the rest of the Git options, see the [Plugin
Preferences](../../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/Plugin_Preferences)
page. Before you can use Source Control for your project, you need to go
into the Game Options and enable Source Control:
