  Before we canÂ use the Git plugin, we need to set up the Git executable to use by going into the
  <a href="../../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/Plugin_Preferences.htm">
   Plugins - Source Control (Git)
  </a>
  section of the
  <a href="../../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences.htm">

  The Git executable path should be auto-filled if it's found by GameMaker, however if the field is empty, you can click on the

  button and manually select the

  file included in
  <span>

  </span>
  folder of your Git installation, which is usually inside
  <span>
   C:\Program Files\Git\
  </span>
  .
