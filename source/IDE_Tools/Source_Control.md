# Source Control

**Source Control Management** (SCM) is the name given to the method of
working with **sub-versions** or backups of your projects through a
repository and local source. Basically, an SCM solution is an
independent software package which controls all the aspects of
maintaining, changing and comparing versions of your project as you work
on it. This is especially useful to those that work in a team and need
to be able to control who does what and not worry about losing data or
making changes that may need to be undone at a later date, but
individuals can benefit from this powerful yet flexible system too.
GameMaker makes use of [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for its SCM, which
must be installed and set up separately before SCM can be used within
GameMaker. See the [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) for more
specific info regarding Git. Below you can find links to a small
tutorial on how to set up this plugin and use the SCM tools with a
project. **IMPORTANT!** We recommend that you have some working
knowledge of how source control works before attempting to use it in
GameMaker .

    Tools](Source_Control/External_Merge_Diff_Tools)

GameMaker will show a drop-down menu in the Menu Bar for Source Control,
which will be populated with the following options once Source Control
has been activated for your project (see the section [Setting Up The Git
Plugin](Source_Control/Setting_Up_Git_Plugin) above for details):

Here we outline each of the available options (most of them are
explained in more depth in the tutorial sections above):

-   **Create Project Repository** : This option permits you to create a
    local repository in the same directory as your project files.
-   **Clone Repository** : This option will permit you to clone a
    repository from a source to a new destination.
-   **Commit Changes** : With this option you can stage changed files in
    your project and then commit them to the repository.
-   **Push Changes** : After doing a commit or a merge this option is
    used to push the changes to the master repository.
-   **Pull Changes** : With this option you can update the local
    repository by pulling the changed files from the master repository.
-   **View History** : This will open the history window where you can
    view all the version history of the project and choose to roll back
    specific file paths or whole revisions.
-   **Show Conflicts** : This will open the Conflicts window and list
    any conflicted files that may exist in the project, permitting you
    to deal with them either through the GameMaker IDE or using a
    specific Merge Tool.
