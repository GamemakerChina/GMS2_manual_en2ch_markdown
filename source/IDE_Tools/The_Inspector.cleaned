   The Inspector
  </h1>
  The
  <strong>
   Inspector
  </strong>
  window shows all the properties associated with the selected elements in the IDE.
  
  
   This window will show information about the element(s) being inspected and allow you to change its various properties:

  It can be opened from
  <a href="../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_Windows_Menu.htm">
   The Windows Menu
  </a>
  at the top of the GameMaker window, and you can open as many as you like:

  After opening an Inspector window, you can dock it anywhere in the IDE, or use it as a floating window:

  <h2>
   Using the Inspector
  </h2>
  The Inspector is very useful for viewing and editing assets without having to rely solely on
  <a href="../Introduction/Workspaces.htm">
   Workspaces
  </a>
  .
  
  
   For example, you may usually edit your object code in fullscreen, and frequently navigate back into a Workspace to edit that object's properties.
  
  
   With the Inspector, you can view an object's details while remaining in fullscreen view:
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/IDE%20Tools/Inspector_Object_Editing.png"/><br/>
  This makes it possible to modify an object's properties and delete/change events while editing its code in fullscreen, and also set up Parenting, Variable Definitions, and more.
  
  
   While this particular example only covers objects, the Inspector can do much more and allow you to edit many different kinds of assets (e.g. Sprites, Fonts, Animation Curves, etc.).
  
  
   You can also edit multiple assets at once, by selecting your desired assets in the
  <a href="../Introduction/The_Asset_Browser.htm">
   Asset Browser
  </a>
  and modifying their properties in your currently active Inspector window.
  <h3>
   Room Layers
  </h3>
  In addition to assets, you can also inspect specific elements in the IDE, such as layers in a room. Using the Inspector on room layers allows you to change its properties and apply a filter/effect to it:

  <span>
   NOTE
  </span>
  When you apply a filter/effect to a non-FX layer using the Inspector, it will always be applied as a "single layer" effect, i.e. its effect will only be applied on that particular layer and not on other layers below it.
  <h2>
   Multiple Inspectors
  </h2>
  You can open multiple Inspector windows at any time, and each one can be linked to a specific element in the IDE. To ensure that each time you click an element all open inspectors don't change to show the new selection, you must first
  <strong>
   lock
  </strong>
  each inspector window one-by-one. To do this, you would open an inspector, select an IDE element to inspect, and then click the
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Padlock.png"/><br/>
  lock button on the inspector to lock it on the element (shown in the image below). Once you have locked an inspector, you can open another one and then repeat the process.
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/IDE%20Tools/Inspector_Lock.png"/><br/>
  Note that a locked inspector window does not lock the editing of any values for the element being inspected. It simply locks the inspector to the selected element and you can continue to edit it at any time, even when the original element is not the main focus of the IDE.
  
  
   Using the lock feature you can open multiple inspectors at the same time with each one being locked to a specific asset, as shown in the example below:
