  <h1>
   exit
  </h1>
  The
  <span>
   exit
  </span>
  statement has the following syntax:
  <pre><code class="language-gml">exit;
</code></pre>
  <span>
   exit
  </span>
  simply ends the execution of the current
  <a href="../Script_Functions.htm">
   script function
  </a>
  ,
  <a href="../Method_Variables.htm">
   method
  </a>
  , or
  <a href="../../../The_Asset_Editors/Object_Properties/Object_Events.htm">
   event
  </a>
  . Note there is a slight difference in use here depending on the scope:
  <ul>
   <li>
    If you use
    <span>
     exit
    </span>
    in a script function or method it will simply exit the function and return to the code that called the function.
   </li>
   <li>
    If you use
    <span>
     exit
    </span>
    in a code block within an object's event, it will exit
    <i>
     the entire event
    </i>
    even if there are various separate code blocks after
    <span>
     exit
    </span>
    has been called.
   </li>
   <li>
    If you use
    <span>
     exit
    </span>
    in a parent event and call that event using
    <a href="../../GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Objects/Object_Events/event_inherited.htm">
     <span>
      event_inherited()
     </span>
    </a>
    in a child object, only the parent event will exit and the child's event (which called
    <span>
     event_inherited()
    </span>
    ) will continue.
   </li>
  </ul>
  When used in an event,
  <span>
   exit
  </span>
  is typically used to avoid an instance running any further code when a specific condition has been met (or not). The code below outlines an example of how it could be used, in this case within a Collision Event, although it can be used in any event.
  <pre><code class="language-gml">if (!visible)
{
    exit;
}

other.hp -= attack;
other.coins -= 4;
coins += 4;
</code></pre>
  The above code checks if the current instance is not visible, in that case it exits the code block, otherwise it goes ahead and runs the rest of the code.
  <b>
   NOTE
  </b>
  : It does not end the execution of the game. For that you need to use the function
  <span>
   <a href="../../GML_Reference/General_Game_Control/game_end.htm">
    <span>
     game_end()
    </span>
   </a>
  </span>
  .
