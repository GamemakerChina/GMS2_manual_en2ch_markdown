  <h1>
   new
  </h1>
  The
  <span>
   new
  </span>
  operator can be used to create a struct with a function which is called with the given arguments. The function can then populate the struct with variables from the arguments - much like the create event of an instance will set the initial variables for the instance - and then the
  <span>
   new
  </span>
  operator will return the struct. Before using this operator it is important to note that the function given
  <i>
   must be flagged as a
   <span>
    constructor
   </span>
   function
  </i>
  otherwise the
  <span>
   new
  </span>
  operator will not create the struct (the code example below shows this, and for more information, please see the page on
  <a href="../Structs.htm">
   Structs
  </a>
  ).
  <span>
   NOTE
  </span>
  You can check a struct to find out which function was used to create it using the runtime function
  <a href="../../GML_Reference/Variable_Functions/instanceof.htm">
   <span>
    instanceof()
   </span>
  </a>
  .
  
  
   This operator has the following syntax:
  <pre><code class="language-gml">&amp;amp;lt;variable&amp;amp;gt; = new &amp;amp;lt;function&amp;amp;gt; (&amp;amp;lt;argument&amp;amp;gt;, &amp;amp;lt;argument&amp;amp;gt;, ...);
</code></pre>
  When you use the new operator along with a function, it will return a struct reference which is stored in the given variable, permitting you to access the struct and any variables that were created within it by the function.
  
  
   The following example shows a function that has been defined to use as a constructor:
  <pre><code class="language-gml">function init_struct(_a, _b, _c) constructor
{
    a = _a;
    b = _b;
    c = _c;
}
</code></pre>
  This function can then be used along with the
  <span>
   new
  </span>
  operator to create a struct and populate it with the variables set to the values of the arguments used in the function, like this:
  <pre><code class="language-gml">mystruct = new init_struct(10, 100, "Hello World");
</code></pre>
  It is important to note that calling new on any function that has
  <em>
   not
  </em>
  been flagged as a constructor will cause a
  <a href="../../../Additional_Information/Errors/Runner_Errors.htm">
   runtime exception
  </a>
  .
