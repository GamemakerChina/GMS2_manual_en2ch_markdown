#  GML Code  Overview

This section of the manual contains all the information required to
understand and use GML Code . The runtime functions in this language can
be used to create your games and is added into objects from the [Object
Editor](../../The_Asset_Editors/Objects) , although it can also be
used along with [GML
Visual](../../Drag_And_Drop/Drag_And_Drop_Index) . Below you can see
a typical image of an object with the code editor open on an event:

Each event has its own tab in the editor and you can add, edit, or
remove code from them at any time (for more information on events see
[Object
Events](../../The_Asset_Editors/Object_Properties/Object_Events) ).
The code itself must have a basic structure and can contain resource
indices, variables, functions, expressions, keywords,Â etc. all of which
are explained in the sections below. If you are a novice to programming
or making the switch from [GML
Visual](../../Drag_And_Drop/Drag_And_Drop_Index) , it is recommended
that you start with the page on [Basic Code
Structure](Basic_Code_Structure) and then read through all the other
pages in this section, testing code from each one within GameMaker
itself.
