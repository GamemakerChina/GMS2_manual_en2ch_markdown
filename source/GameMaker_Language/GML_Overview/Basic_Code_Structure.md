# Basic Code Structure

Code is written in *blocks* and a typical code block consists of a set
of instructions, called statement s , that are then interpreted by
GameMaker and used to make something happen within your game. That
"something" can be as simple as adding 2 and 2 to get 4, or as complex
as making an enemy run away when their health gets below a certain
value. The actual structure of the program can vary greatly, depending
on the functions it uses, but broken down to basics it just looks like
this:

``` gml
&amp;lt;statement&amp;gt;;
&amp;lt;statement&amp;gt;;
...
```

Statements should be separated with a ';' symbol to prevent errors with
variable declarations and to keep your code clean and tidy, and they can
consist of variable declarations, expression s and calls to specific
**functions** . You can also "group" statements together as a block
using the curly brackets {} so that they run together, like in the
following conditional example:

``` gml
if (&amp;lt;conditional&amp;gt;)
{
    &amp;lt;statement&amp;gt;;
    &amp;lt;statement&amp;gt;;
    ...
}
```

NOTE The GameMaker Language will also accept begin and end instead of
the curly brackets {} , although this is not typically the most common
way to do it:

``` gml
if (&amp;lt;conditional&amp;gt;)
begin
    &amp;lt;statement&amp;gt;;
    &amp;lt;statement&amp;gt;;
    ...
end
```

Here is a more visual representation of how a code block can look, this
time created as a **script** in the GameMaker [Script
Editor](../../The_Asset_Editors/Scripts) :

There are a number of different types of statements, expressions,
conditionals and functions, all of which are discussed at length in
subsequent sections of the manual. NOTE If you are new to programming
then you may want to check out the [Quick Start
Guide](../../Quick_Start_Guide/Quick_Start_Guide) before continuing.
