  <h1>
   Basic Code Structure
  </h1>
  Code is written in
  <em>
   blocks
  </em>
  and a typical code block consists of a set of instructions, called
  <a>
   statement
  </a>
  <span>
   s
  </span>
  , that are then interpreted by
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  and used to make something happen within your game. That "something" can be as simple as adding 2 and 2 to get 4, or as complex as making an enemy run away when their health gets below a certain value. The actual structure of the program can vary greatly, depending on the functions it uses, but broken down to basics it just looks like this:
  <pre><code class="language-gml">&amp;amp;lt;statement&amp;amp;gt;;
&amp;amp;lt;statement&amp;amp;gt;;
...
</code></pre>
  Statements should be separated with a ';' symbol to prevent errors with
  <a>
   variable
  </a>
  declarations and to keep your code clean and tidy, and they can consist of variable declarations,
  <a>
   expression
  </a>
  <span>
   s
  </span>
  and calls to specific
  <strong>
   functions
  </strong>
  . You can also "group" statements together as a block using the curly brackets
  <span>
   {}
  </span>
  so that they run together, like in the following
  <a>
   conditional
  </a>
  example:
  <pre><code class="language-gml">if (&amp;amp;lt;conditional&amp;amp;gt;)
{
    &amp;amp;lt;statement&amp;amp;gt;;
    &amp;amp;lt;statement&amp;amp;gt;;
    ...
}
</code></pre>
  <span>
   NOTE
  </span>
  The GameMaker Language will also accept
  <span>
   begin
  </span>
  <span>
  </span>
  and
  <span>
   end
  </span>
  <span>
  </span>
  instead of the curly brackets
  <span>
   {}
  </span>
  , although this is not typically the most common way to do it:
  <pre><code class="language-gml">if (&amp;amp;lt;conditional&amp;amp;gt;)
begin
    &amp;amp;lt;statement&amp;amp;gt;;
    &amp;amp;lt;statement&amp;amp;gt;;
    ...
end
</code></pre>
  Here is a more visual representation of how a code block can look, this time created as a
  <b>
   script
  </b>
  in the
  <span>
   GameMaker

  There are a number of different types of statements, expressions, conditionals and functions, all of which are discussed at length in subsequent sections of the manual.
