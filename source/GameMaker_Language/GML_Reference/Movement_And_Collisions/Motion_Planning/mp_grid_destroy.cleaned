  <h1>
   mp_grid_destroy
  </h1>
  You can use this function to destroy the indicated mp_grid (as defined by the function
  <a href="mp_grid_create.htm">
   <span>
    mp_grid_create()
   </span>
  </a>
  ) and free up the memory allocated it. It is
  <i>
   essential
  </i>
  that you call this whenever the MP grid is finished with or you could potentially get a memory leak, meaning that your game will slow down over time and eventually crash.
  <b>
   NOTE
  </b>
  : Using
  <span>
   mp_grid_*
  </span>
  functions on a grid after it has been destroyed will result in an error.
