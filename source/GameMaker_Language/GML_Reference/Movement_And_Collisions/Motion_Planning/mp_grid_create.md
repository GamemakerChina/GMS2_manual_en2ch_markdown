# mp_grid_create

With this function you can create an mp_grid for the motion planning
functions. It returns an index that should be stored in a variable for
use in all the other MP grid function calls. The x and y coordinates
indicate the position of the top-left corner of the grid, hcells and
vcells indicate the number of horizontal and vertical cells to be
created within the grid, and cell width and cell height indicate the
size of the cells in pixels. You can create and maintain multiple grid
structures at the same moment if you need them for different things, but
be aware that each grid will require memeory, and the more cells they
have the more memory they will require.Â Also note that the MP functions
are quite processor heavy to use so the more often you call them and the
higher the cell resolution then the more likely you are to have a drop
in performance.

#### Syntax:

``` gml
mp_grid_create(left, top, hcells, vcells, cellwidth, cellheight);
```

| Argument   | Type                                                                    | Description                                                   |
| left       |  [Real](../../../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Data_Types)  | Starting x coordinate of the mp_grid in the room              |
| top        |  [Real](../../../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Data_Types)  | Starting y coordinate of the mp_grid in the room              |
| hcells     |  [Real](../../../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Data_Types)  | Number of horizontal cells that the mp_grid will contain      |
| vcells     |  [Real](../../../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Data_Types)  | Number of vertical cells that the mp_grid will contain        |
| cellwidth  |  [Real](../../../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Data_Types)  | The width (in pixels) of each individual cell of the mp_grid  |
| cellheight |  [Real](../../../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Data_Types)  | The height (in pixels) of each individual cell of the mp_grid |

#### Returns:

``` gml
 MP Grid ID
```

#### Example:

``` gml
global.grid = mp_grid_create(0, 0, room_width / 32, room_height / 32, 32, 32);
```

The above code creates a global variable "grid", then generates an
mp_grid and assigns its index (id) to that variable for use in all
further mp_grid function calls. The grid covers the room, with a cell
resolution of 32x32 pixels. This means that, for example, in a room that
is 640x480, the grid would contain 300 cells: 20 horizontal cells (640 /
32) multiplied by 15 vertical cells (480 /32) gives 300 cells
