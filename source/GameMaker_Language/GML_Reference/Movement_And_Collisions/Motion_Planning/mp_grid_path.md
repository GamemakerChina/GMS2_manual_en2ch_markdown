# mp_grid_path

With this function you can create a path that will navigate from a start
point to a finish point using an mp_grid that you have previously
defined, avoiding any obstacles that have already been added into the
grid. The xstart and ystart arguments indicate the start of the path in
room coordinates, while xgoal, ygoal arguments indicate the destination.
You can also select either horizontal/vertical movement only, or allow
full diagonal movements by specifying true in the allowdiag argument.
The function returns either true (it succeeded in finding a path) or
false (it failed) as well as setting the chosen path. In the following
image, you can see how this all works together:  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/GML/Reference/Movement_Collisions/mp_grid_path_image.png)  
As you can see, the "pipe" objects have been added into the grid,
meaning that any path created has to go around them. There are two paths
created in the image, one (green) has been made with diagonals allowed
and the other (red) without. The difference between the two is pretty
obvious with the green path appearing much more "elegant" and direct,
but it all depends what use you are going to put them to which one you
prefer. Note that the path is independent of the current instance - it
is a path through the grid, not a path for a specific instance, even
though a specific instance may have the variable that stores the path
index. You may also need to debug these paths to see how they are made
and interact within the game environment, in which case you should be
using the [draw_path()](../../Drawing/Basic_Forms/draw_path)
function. **NOTE** : The path must have been previously created (either
in code with [ path_add()
](../../Asset_Management/Paths/Path_Manipulation/path_add) or as a
resource) and will be replaced by the path generated by this function.

#### Syntax:

``` gml
mp_grid_path(id, path, xstart, ystart, xgoal, ygoal, allowdiag);

#### Returns:

``` gml
 Boolean
```

#### Example:

``` gml
global.grid = mp_grid_create(0, 0, room_width div 32, room_height div 32, 32, 32);
mp_grid_add_instances(global.grid, obj_wall, false);
with (obj_Enemy)
{
    path = path_add();
    if mp_grid_path(global.grid, path, x, y, obj_Player.x, obj_Player.y, 1)
    {
        path_start(path, 0, 3, 0);
    }
}
```

The above code creates a global variable "global.grid", then generates
an mp_grid and assigns its index (id) to that variable for use in all
further mp_grid function calls. It then adds all instances of "obj_Wall"
into the grid before getting all instances of "obj_Enemy" to create a
path and then use mp_grid_path to calculate a rout from their position
to the position of "obj_Player". If a route exists then the object
starts itself along the path.
