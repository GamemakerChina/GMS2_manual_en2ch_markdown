# device_get_tilt_z

This function returns a value between -1 and 1 depending upon the angle
of "tilt" of the device. The actual correlation between degrees of tilt
and the value returned depends on the device and OS that it uses, but
generally a value of 1 or -1 is the same as +/-90Â°. The image below
shows how each if the available functions relates to the device:
