# keyboard_clear

With this function you can clear the current keyboard state, which
essentially means that if the key is being held down, it will no longer
be recognised until it is released again (which won't trigger the
Keyboard Key Released event either on this occasion) and pressed
again.Â The function will take a keycode value as returned by the
function [ ord() ](../../Strings/ord) (only *capital* letters from
A-Z or numbers from 0-9), or any of the vk\_\* constants listed on the
main [Keyboard Input](Keyboard_Input) page.

#### **Syntax:**

``` gml
keyboard_clear(key);
```
