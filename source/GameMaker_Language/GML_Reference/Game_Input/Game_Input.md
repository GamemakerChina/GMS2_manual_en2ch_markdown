# Game Input

The fundamental thing that makes a game a *game* is the interaction with
the player. This is achieved by a variety of means, with the keyboard
and mouse on computers and through the touch screen and device tilting
on mobile, oe even through a gamepad on all the platforms! To begin with
in GameMaker you would use the dedicated [mouse or keyboard
events](../../../The_Asset_Editors/Object_Properties/Object_Events)
on PCs or the [gesture
events](../../../The_Asset_Editors/Object_Properties/Gesture_Events)
on mobile, but sometimes you need more control than these events
provide, or you want to include gamepad controls or multiple different
control options. For that you can use the different game input functions
to get which buttons or keys have been pressed or released as well as
retrieve the touches on a screen or how much a gamepad joystick has been
moved. There are a great number of functions for game input and control
in yourÂ games, and so they have been split into sections related to
specific input methods to make it easier to find what you need. The
available sections are:

-   [Keyboard Input](Keyboard_Input/Keyboard_Input)
-   [Mouse Input](Mouse_Input/Mouse_Input)
-   [Device Input](Device_Input/Device_Input)
-   [Gesture Input](Gesture_Input/Gesture_Input)
-   [GamePad Input](GamePad_Input/Gamepad_Input)
-   [Virtual Keys And Virtual
    Keyboards](Virtual_Keys_And_Keyboards/Virtual_Keys_And_Keyboards)
