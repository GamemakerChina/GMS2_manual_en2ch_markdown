  <h1>
   gesture_tap_count
  </h1>
  This function is used to set whether tap counting is enabled or disabled. When set to
  <span>
   true
  </span>
  tap counting is enabled, and when set to
  <span>
   false
  </span>
  it is disabled, although you can check which state it is in using the function
  <a href="gesture_get_tap_count.htm">
   <span>
    gesture_get_tap_count()
   </span>
  </a>
  . When enabled, each tap event will have an additional "tapcount" DS map entry which will have registered the number of taps, and when enabled it means that
  <i>
   all
  </i>
  tap events will be triggered, ie: two taps will trigger both the single tap event and the double tap event, with the single tap event tap count being 1 and the double tap event tap count being 2. The tap count value will be reset to 0 after the time set for a double-tap detection has passed (see the function
  <a href="gesture_double_tap_time.htm">
   <span>
    gesture_double_tap_time()
   </span>
  </a>
  ). If tap counting is disabled, then the initial tap won't be registered until the double-tap time has passed and no second tap has been detected. Note that this is
  <b>
   enabled
  </b>
  by default.
