  <h1>
   draw_set_alpha
  </h1>
  With this function you can set the base draw alpha for the game. This value can be set from 0 to 1 with 0 being fully transparent and 1 being fully opaque (the default value), and will affect all further drawing, including backgrounds, sprites, fonts,
    primitives and 3D.
  
  
   Note that if you are drawing any of the assets and supplying an alpha argument as part of the function (for example, when using
  <a href="../Sprites_And_Tiles/draw_sprite_ext.htm">
   <span>
    draw_sprite_ext()
   </span>
  </a>
  ), then the alpha value set here will be
    overridden, so drawing a sprite using
  <span>
   draw_sprite_ext()
  </span>
  with an alpha argument of 1 will draw the sprite fully opaque regardless of the alpha set with
  <span>
   draw_set_alpha()
  </span>
  (this will work the same when using
  <a href="../Sprites_And_Tiles/draw_self.htm">
   <span>
    draw_self()
   </span>
  </a>
  and setting the
  <a href="../../Asset_Management/Sprites/Sprite_Instance_Variables/image_alpha.htm">
   <span>
    image_alpha
   </span>
  </a>
  of the instance). Also note that when an instance is
  <i>
   default
  </i>
  drawing (ie: it has a sprite but no Draw Event), then the
  <span>
   image_alpha
  </span>
  variable will be clamped to the alpha set with
  <span>
   draw_set_alpha()
  </span>
  , such that an
  <span>
   image_alpha
  </span>
  of 1 and a draw alpha of 0.5 will draw the sprite at alpha 0.5, while an
  <span>
   image_alpha
  </span>
  of 0.25 and a draw alpha
    of 0.5 will draw the sprite at 0.25 alpha.

  <h4>
   Example:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">draw_set_alpha(0.5); draw_set_colour(c_black);
 draw_text(x+5, y+5, "LEVEL 1"); draw_set_alpha(1);
 draw_set_colour(c_white);
 draw_text(x, y, "LEVEL 1");
</code></pre>
  The above code will draw some text at the specified position with a shadow effect created by modified draw alpha and colour.
