  <h1>
   surface_get_texture
  </h1>
  This function returns a special
  <i>
   pointer
  </i>
  for the surface's texture. This value can then be used in other draw functions, particularly in general 3D and some of the 2D primitive functions.

   NOTE

  When working with surfaces there is the possibility that they can cease to exist at any time due to them being stored in texture memory. You should
  <b>
   ALWAYS
  </b>
  check that a surface exists using
  <span>
   <a href="surface_exists.htm">
    <span>
     surface_exists()
    </span>
   </a>
  </span>
  before referencing them directly.
  <span>
   NOTE

  On HTML5, this returns a struct instead of a texture pointer, as a pointer cannot be used on that platform. However this does not change the use of the returned value, as its usage in
  <a href="../Textures/Textures.htm">
   texture functions
  </a>
  still remains the same.

  <pre><code class="language-gml"><a href="../../../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Sprites/Sprite_Information/sprite_get_texture.htm">
 Texture
</a></code></pre>
  <h4>
   Example:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">var tex;
tex = surface_get_texture(surf);
draw_primitive_begin_texture(pr_trianglestrip, tex);
draw_vertex_texture(0, 480, 0, 0);
draw_vertex_texture(640, 480, 1, 0);
draw_vertex_texture(640, 480, 1, 1);
draw_vertex_texture(0, 480, 0, 1);
draw_primitive_end();
</code></pre>
  The above code will draw a 4 vertex triangle strip textured with the texture held in the "tex" variable, which is itself taken from a previously created surface.
