# Drawing

This section contains all the functions related to drawing within the
game room, as well as for controlling *how* things will be drawn
(blending, alpha, culling, etc...). There are a great number of
different functions for drawing, and they are split over the following
categories to make it easier to find what you need:

-   [Colour And Alpha](Colour_And_Alpha/Colour_And_Alpha)
-   [ GPU Control ](GPU_Control/GPU_Control)
-   [Mipmapping](Mipmapping/Mipmapping)
-   [ Basic Forms ](Basic_Forms/Basic_Forms)
-   [ Sprites And Tiles ](Sprites_And_Tiles/Sprites_And_Tiles)
-   [ Text ](Text/Text)
-   [ PrimitivesÂ And Vertex Formats
    ](Primitives/Primitives_And_Vertex_Formats)
-   [ Surfaces ](Surfaces/Surfaces)
-   [ Lighting ](Lighting/Lighting)
-   [ Particles ](Particles/Particles)
-   [ Textures ](Textures/Textures)
-   [Shaders](../Asset_Management/Shaders/Shaders)
-   [Video Playback](Videos/Videos#h1)

There are two special functions available too, one which is used for
enabling or disabling the **Draw Event** for your project, and the other
for flushing the entire draw pipeline:

-   [draw_enable_drawevent](draw_enable_drawevent)
-   [draw_flush](draw_flush)
