# Tile Sets

The following functions are available when working with tile set assets,
as created in the [Asset
Browser](../../../../The_Asset_Editors/Tile_Sets) . These functions
are *only* for dealing with the asset itself, and not for working with
tiles or tile maps when they are present in your game (for that see the
appropriate layer functions on the section on
[Rooms](../Rooms/Tile_Map_Layers/Tile_Map_Layers) ). The functions
available are:

-   [tileset_get_name](tileset_get_name)
-   [tileset_get_texture](tileset_get_texture)
-   [tileset_get_uvs](tileset_get_uvs)
