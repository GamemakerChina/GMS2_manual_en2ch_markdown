  <h1>
   path_get_name
  </h1>
  This function will return the name of the path that is referenced as a string. The name is whatever has been used to define the path in the editor or (if the path has been created through a code function) it will return a string with the format "
  <span>
   _newpathXX
  </span>
  " where "
  <span>
   XX
  </span>
  " is the number of the path generated, starting at 0 and incrementing by one every time a new path is created. Please note that this is
  <i>
   only
  </i>
  a
      string and cannot be used to reference the path directly - for that you would need the
  <i>
   path index ID
  </i>
  . You can, however, use this string to get the
  <i>
   path index ID
  </i>
  using the returned string along
      with the function
  <a href="../Assets_And_Tags/asset_get_index.htm">
   <span>
    asset_get_index()
   </span>
  </a>
  .
