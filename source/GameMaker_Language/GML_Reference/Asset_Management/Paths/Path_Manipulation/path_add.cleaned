  <h1>
   path_add
  </h1>
  With this function you can create a path in
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  without using the path editor. This function will return the index of the path which should be stored in a variable and used as the reference for that path from then on. Please note that the created path is
  <i>
   empty
  </i>
  ie: it has no points defined, so you will then have to use the
  <a href="path_add_point.htm">
   other available functions
  </a>
  to add points to the path or be using
  <a href="../../../Movement_And_Collisions/Motion_Planning/Motion_Planning.htm">
   MP grids
  </a>
  to generate the path. Once you have finished using the path, or wish to create a new one and store its index in the same variable you should first delete the old path with
  <a href="path_delete.htm">
   <span>
    path_delete
   </span>
  </a>
  to prevent memory leaks which can eventually crash your game.
