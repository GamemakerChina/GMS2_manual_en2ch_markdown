  <h1>
   path_orientation
  </h1>
  This variable holds the current orientation of the path that has been assigned to the instance when the function
  <span>
   <a href="../path_start.htm">
    path_start()
   </a>
  </span>
  was called. When a path is created, its orientation is the default
    0 degrees, but you can set this value to anything you wish using this. Remember that in
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  (unless you are using physics) the angles are calculated counter-clockwise, so setting the path orientation
    to 90° would rotate the path to the
  <i>
   left
  </i>
  .

  <h4>
   Syntax:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">path_orientation;
</code></pre>
  <h4>
   Returns:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml"><a href="../../../../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Data_Types.htm">
 Real
</a></code></pre>
  <h4>
   Example:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">mypath = path_duplicate(choose(path_1, path_2, path_3, path_4)); path_start(path, 4, path_action_reverse, 0); path_orientation = 90;
</code></pre>
  The above code duplicates a random, pre-made path asset into the variable "mypath". This new path is then started and rotated 90°.
