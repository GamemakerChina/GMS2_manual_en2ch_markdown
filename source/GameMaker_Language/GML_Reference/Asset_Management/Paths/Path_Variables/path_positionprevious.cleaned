  <h1>
   path_positionprevious
  </h1>
  This variable can be used to get or to set the position of an instance along its current path in the previous step, and is a normalised value between 0 and 1 ie: 0 is the start position of the path and 1 would be the end position. It is similar to the
  <a href="../../Instances/Instance_Variables/xprevious.htm">
   <span>
    xprevious
   </span>
  </a>
  and
  <a href="../../Instances/Instance_Variables/yprevious.htm">
   <span>
    yprevious
   </span>
  </a>
  variables in how it works, only it is specific for paths. It can be useful for things like temporarily stopping a path follower if something is in the way (see the example code below).
  <h4>
   Syntax:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">path_positionprevious;
</code></pre>
  <h4>
   Returns:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml"><a href="../../../../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Data_Types.htm">
 Real
</a></code></pre>
  <h4>
   Example:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">var _x = x + lengthdir_x(16, direction);
var _y = y + lengthdir_y(16, direction);
if collision_circle(xx, yy, 16, obj_Player, false,true)
{
    path_position = path_positionprevious;
}
</code></pre>
  The above code checks an area in front of the instance for a collision with the object "obj_Player" and if there is one, it sets the instance back to the previous position it occupied on the current path, as assigned by the function
