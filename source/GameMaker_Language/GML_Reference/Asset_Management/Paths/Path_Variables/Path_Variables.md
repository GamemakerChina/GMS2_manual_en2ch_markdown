# Path Variables

The following variables are built-in to all instances when created and
can be used to get information about a path, or to change certain
properties:

-   [path_index](path_index)
-   [path_position](path_position)
-   [path_positionprevious](path_positionprevious)
-   [path_speed](path_speed)
-   [path_scale](path_scale)
-   [path_orientation](path_orientation)
-   [path_endaction](path_endaction)
