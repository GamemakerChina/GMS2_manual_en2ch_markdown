   Paths

  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  has an extensive collection of functions and built-in variables for using paths within your game. This section deals with the basic ones that are used when dealing with paths that have previously been created in the
  <a href="../../../../The_Asset_Editors/Paths.htm">
   Path Editor
  </a>
  , but further functions exist that permit you to create your own paths using code, and to manipulate them in various ways.
  
  
   The following basic functions exist that deal with paths:
  <ul>
   <li>
    <a href="path_start.htm">
     path_start
    </a>
   </li>
   <li>
    <a href="path_end.htm">
     path_end
    </a>
   </li>
   <li>
    <a href="path_get_closed.htm">
     path_get_closed
    </a>
   </li>
   <li>
    <a href="path_get_kind.htm">
     path_get_kind
    </a>
   </li>
   <li>
    <a href="path_get_length.htm">
     path_get_length
    </a>
   </li>
   <li>
    <a href="path_get_name.htm">
     path_get_name
    </a>
   </li>
   <li>
    <a href="path_get_number.htm">
     path_get_number
    </a>
   </li>
   <li>
    <a href="path_get_point_speed.htm">
     path_get_point_speed
    </a>
   </li>
   <li>
    <a href="path_get_point_x.htm">
     path_get_point_x
    </a>
   </li>
   <li>
    <a href="path_get_point_y.htm">
     path_get_point_y
    </a>
   </li>
   <li>
    <a href="path_get_precision.htm">
     path_get_precision
    </a>
   </li>
   <li>
    <a href="path_get_speed.htm">
     path_get_speed
    </a>
   </li>
   <li>
    <a href="path_get_x.htm">
     path_get_x
    </a>
   </li>
   <li>
    <a href="path_get_y.htm">
     path_get_y
    </a>
   </li>
  </ul>
  To aid with debugging paths, you have a function to draw it to the screen too:
  <ul>
   <li>
    <a href="../../Drawing/Basic_Forms/draw_path.htm">
     draw_path
    </a>
   </li>
  </ul>
  Each instance of an object also has a series of built-in variables designed to make using paths easier, and these variables are listed in the following section:
  <ul>
   <li>
    <a href="Path_Variables/Path_Variables.htm">
     Path Variables
    </a>
   </li>
  </ul>
  Finally, it is possible to manipulate the contents of a path as well as create new paths when the game is running. The functions that enable these things and more are available from the following section:
  <ul>
   <li>
    <a href="Path_Manipulation/Path_Manipulation.htm">
     Path Manipulation
    </a>
   </li>
  </ul>
