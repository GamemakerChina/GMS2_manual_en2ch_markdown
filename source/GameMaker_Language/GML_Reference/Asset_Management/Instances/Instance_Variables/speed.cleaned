  <h1>
   speed
  </h1>
  All instances in
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  have certain "built in" properties that you can use and set to govern how they look and behave.
  <span>
   speed
  </span>
  is one of those properties and defines how many pixels the instance will move every step.
    Unlike
  <a href="hspeed.htm">
   <span>
    hspeed
   </span>
  </a>
  and
  <a href="vspeed.htm">
   <span>
    vspeed
   </span>
  </a>
  ,
  <span>
   speed
  </span>
  has no direction associated with it as this is governed by the
  <a href="direction.htm">
   <span>
    direction
   </span>
  </a>
  value of the instance, but it
    can have a negative value, in which case the instance will travel in the opposite direction to that set by the
  <span>
   direction
  </span>
  function (ie:
  <span>
   direction
  </span>
  - 180Â°). Note that setting the
  <span>
   speed
  </span>
  and/or the
  <span>
   direction
  </span>
  ,
    will also modify the values of the
  <span>
   hspeed
  </span>
  and
  <span>
   vspeed
  </span>
  variables, and that

   </span>
  </a>
  and

  can all modify the value of this variable when they are used in your games.
  <h4>
   Syntax:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">speed;
</code></pre>
  <h4>
   Returns:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml"><a href="../../../../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Data_Types.htm">
 Real
</a>
(single precision floating point value)
</code></pre>
  <h4>
   Example:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">if keyboard_check(vk_up) speed = 2; if keyboard_check(vk_left) direction += 5; if keyboard_check(vk_right) direction -= 5;
</code></pre>
  The above code will use the arrow keys to set the speed and direction of the instance.
