  </h1>
  All instances in
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  have certain "built in" properties that you can use and set to govern how they look and behave.
  <span>
   Direction
  </span>
  is one of those properties and can be used to set the direction of movement of the
    instance when the instance has a
  <a href="speed.htm">
   <span>
    speed
   </span>
  </a>
  other than 0. Note that directions in
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  are usually calculated as 0째 being right, 90째 being up, 180째 being left and 270째 being down, and that the

   <span>
    gravity
   </span>
  </a>
  and
  <a href="gravity_direction.htm">
   <span>
    gravity_direction
   </span>
  </a>
  variables can modify the
  <span>
   direction
  </span>
  value when they are used in your games.
