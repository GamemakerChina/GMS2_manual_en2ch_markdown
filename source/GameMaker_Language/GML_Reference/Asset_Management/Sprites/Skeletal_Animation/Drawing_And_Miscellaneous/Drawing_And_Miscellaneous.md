# Drawing And Miscellaneous

The following functions are additional tools for gettingÂ various
different sets of data about a skeleton animation sprite:

-   [skeleton_get_minmax](skeleton_get_minmax)
-   [skeleton_get_num_bounds](skeleton_get_num_bounds)
-   [skeleton_get_bounds](skeleton_get_bounds)

You can also use various draw functions designed specifically for these
types of sprite (apart from the regular [ draw_sprite()
](../../../../Drawing/Sprites_And_Tiles/Sprites_And_Tiles)
functions). These functions give you more control over what is being
drawn and permit you to change animation specific features, such as
timing and skins:

-   [skeleton_collision_draw_set](skeleton_collision_draw_set)
-   [draw_skeleton](draw_skeleton)
-   [draw_skeleton_instance](draw_skeleton_instance)
-   [draw_skeleton_collision](draw_skeleton_collision)
-   [draw_skeleton_time](draw_skeleton_time)
-   [draw_enable_skeleton_blendmodes](draw_enable_skeleton_blendmodes)
-   [draw_get_enable_skeleton_blendmodes](draw_get_enable_skeleton_blendmodes)
