# Bones

As the name implies, skeleton animation sprites are comprised of a
series of "bones", over which a [skin](../Skins/Skins) is added to
create the final character animation. Normally you'd want to set these
bones up in the animation software (Spine) and then export the sprite
with a set of animations already preset so you can simply [switch
between](../Animation/Animation) them as required. However, there
are times when you may want to intercept the bone data and manually
manipulate it or get information about the position of specific bones,
and in these cases you can use the following functions:

-   [skeleton_bone_data_get](skeleton_bone_data_get)
-   [skeleton_bone_data_set](skeleton_bone_data_set)
-   [skeleton_bone_state_get](skeleton_bone_state_get)
-   [skeleton_bone_state_set](skeleton_bone_state_set)
-   [skeleton_bone_list](skeleton_bone_list)
