# skeleton_bone_state_set

Your skeletal animation is made up of a number of "bones", which you
will have defined and given names to in your animation program, and this
function can be used to set certain data for the named bone at any time.
Note that this data will set the **current** pose for the skeleton,
depending on the animation set used, and the function requires a
previously created
[DSÂ map](../../../../Data_Structures/DS_Maps/DS_Maps) , which should
have the following keys and their required values:

-   **"x":** The local x position of the bone relative to the parent
    bone.
-   **"y":** The local y position of the bone relative to the parent
    bone.
-   **"angle":** The local rotation of the bone relative to the parent
    bone.
-   **"xscale":** The local horizontal scale of the bone.
-   **"yscale":** The local vertical scale of the bone.
-   **"parent":** The name (a string) of the parent bone.

This function is provided so that you can "intercept" animation data and
modify it before it is drawn on the screen, and as such you would want
to use it in the [Other - Animation
Update](../../../../../../The_Asset_Editors/Object_Properties/Other_Events)
event, since this event is triggered just before the Draw Events. Note
that you can use the same map you filled out using the [
skeleton_bone_state_get() ](skeleton_bone_state_get) function, even
though it contains the additional "World" keys and values. Since these
refer to *read-only* values, setting them with this function will have
no affect.

#### Syntax:

``` gml
skeleton_bone_state_set(bone, map);
```

|          |                                                                                                                |                                                            |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Argument | Type                                                                                                           | Description                                                |
| bone     |  [String](../../../../../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Data_Types)                                 | The name (as a string) of the bone.                        |
| map      |  [DS Map ID](../../../../../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Data_Structures/DS_Maps/ds_map_create)  | The (previously created) DS map that stores the bone data. |

#### Returns:

``` gml
N/A
```

#### Example:

``` gml
var map = ds_map_create();
skeleton_bone_state_get("head", map);
var xx = ds_map_find_value(map, "worldX");
var yy = ds_map_find_value(map, "worldY");
var deltax = mouse_x - (x + xx);
var deltay = mouse_y - (y + yy);
var angle = -radtodeg(arctan2(deltay, deltax));
ds_map_replace(map, "angle", angle);
skeleton_bone_state_set("head", map);
ds_map_destroy(map);
```

The above code creates a DS map and then populates it with the data from
the bone named "head". It then extracts the world position for the bone,
and uses that data to set the "angle" of the bone to track the mouse
position in the game.
