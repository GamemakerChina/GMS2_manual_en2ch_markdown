  <h1>
   Slots
  </h1>
  Skeleton animation sprites can have "slots" where you can place "attachments". An attachment is simply an image that can used as a propÂ by the sprite, and is placed in a slot so that it will move along with the animation of the part where the slot is positioned. If you imagine the sprite of a warrior with an attachment slot on his hand - you can then place different weapon sprites on this slot and make the warrior look like he's using a sword or a pike or a shield or whatever.
  
  
   This section deals specifically with slots and their setup and use, however you can also setup attachments and get information about them from the functions listed
