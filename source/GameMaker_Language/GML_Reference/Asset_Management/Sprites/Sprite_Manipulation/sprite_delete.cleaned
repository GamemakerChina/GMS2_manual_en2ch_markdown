  <h1>
   sprite_delete
  </h1>
  This function will delete a sprite from the game, freeing any memory that was reserved for it. This is a very important function for those moments when you need to create and change sprites from external sources (like loading a sprite from a file with
  <span>
   <a href="sprite_add.htm">
    sprite_add()
   </a>
  </span>
  , or duplicating a sprite using
  <span>
   <a href="sprite_duplicate.htm">
    sprite_duplicate()
   </a>
  </span>
  ) and should always be used to remove those assets that are no longer
    needed by a game, or to clear an indexed asset from a variable before re-assigning another asset to that variable.
  <b>
   This cannot be used to delete sprites that are included in the game as part of the assets in the Asset Browser
  </b>
  .
  <h4>
   Syntax:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">sprite_delete(index);
</code></pre>
  <table>
   <tbody>
    <tr>
     <th>
      Argument
     </th>
     <th>
      Type
     </th>
     <th>
      Description
     </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>
      index
     </td>
     <td>
      <span>
       <a href="../../../../../../The_Asset_Editors/Sprites.htm">
        Sprite Asset
       </a>
      </span>
     </td>
     <td>
      The index of the sprite to be deleted.
     </td>
    </tr>
   </tbody>
  </table>
  <h4>
   Returns
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">N/A
</code></pre>
  <h4>
   Example:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">var spr = sprite_create_from_surface(application_surface, 0, 0, 32, 32, false, false, 16, 16); sprite_merge(spr_Player, spr); sprite_delete(spr);
</code></pre>
  The above code creates a local variable and then stores the index of the sprite created from the application surface. This sprite is then merged with the asset indexed in the variable "spr_Player" before being removed from memory again.
