  </h1>
  With this function you can make your game go to the next one as listed in the
  <a href="../../../../Settings/The_Room_Manager.htm">
   Room Manager
  </a>
  at the time the game was compiled. If this room does not exist, an error will be thrown and the game will be forced to close. Note that the room will not change until the end of the event where the function was called, so any code after this has been called will still run if in the same event.

   NOTE

  You will not be able to create new instances in the same event after this function has been called.
