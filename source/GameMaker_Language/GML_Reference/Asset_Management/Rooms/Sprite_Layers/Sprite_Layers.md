# Sprite Layers

The GameMaker [Room Editor](../../../../../The_Asset_Editors/Rooms)
permits you to add sprites into any given room using *layers* . As the
name implies, a layer is simply a collection of assets that are all
considered to be at the same depth within the room, and by stacking
layers you can make some things draw over or under others. You can also
control certain aspects of layers from code, adding or removing things,
or changing certain properties of the layer or what it contains at run
time. Below is a list of all the functions that can be used for editing
[Sprites](../../Sprites/Sprites) that have been added to an [**asset
