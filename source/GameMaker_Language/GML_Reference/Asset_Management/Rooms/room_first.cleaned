  <h1>
   room_first
  </h1>
  This
  <b>
   read only
  </b>
  variable returns the index of the very first room in the game (this is defined by the order in which the rooms appear in the
  <a href="../../../../Settings/The_Room_Manager.htm">
   Room Manager
  </a>
  and
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  by the order in which they were created).
  <h4>
   Syntax:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">room_first;
</code></pre>
  <h4>
   Returns:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml"><a href="../../../../../The_Asset_Editors/Rooms.htm">
 Room Asset
</a></code></pre>
  <h4>
   Example:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">if lives &amp;amp;lt; 1
{
    room_goto(room_first);
}
</code></pre>
  The above code will check the "lives" variable and if it is less than 1 go to the first room in the game.
