  <h1>
   room_restart
  </h1>
  This function will restart the current room, as if it had just been entered. Note that the room will not restart until the end of the event where the function was called, so any code after this has been called will still run if in the same event. This function will also trigger the
  <b>
   Room End
  </b>
  event.
  <span>
   NOTE
  </span>
  You will not be able to create new instances in the same event after this function has been called.
