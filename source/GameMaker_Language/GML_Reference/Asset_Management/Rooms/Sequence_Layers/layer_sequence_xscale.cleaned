  <h1>
   layer_sequence_xscale
  </h1>
  With this function you can set the X scale for the given sequence element. You supply the sequence element ID as returned by
  <a href="layer_sequence_create.htm">
   <span>
    layer_sequence_create()
   </span>
  </a>
  or by one of the
  <a href="../General_Layer_Functions/General_Layer_Functions.htm">
   layer element functions
  </a>
  along with the new scale to set on the X axis and the sequence will be scaled by this amount. A scale of 1 indicates no scaling (1:1), smaller values will scale down (0.5, for example, will half the width of the sequence), larger values will scale up and negative values will mirror the sequence about its origin
  <i>
   and
  </i>
  scale it unless the value used is exactly -1 (in which case the sequence is just mirrored about its origin with no scaling).
  
  
   It is very important to note that applying
  <em>
   uneven
  </em>
  scaling (eg: scaling the X axis by 3 and the Y axis by 2) to sequence elements that contain any instance which uses
  <em>
   rotation
  </em>
  ,
  <strong>
   may cause issues with the instance drawing, collisions, culling, and many other things
  </strong>
  . Basically, if your sequence relies on
  <em>
   any
  </em>
  instance properties then we do not recommend that you combine uneven scaling along with instance rotation.
  
  
   Also note that you shouldn't change the

  <h4>
   Returns:

  <pre><code class="language-gml">N/A
</code></pre>
  <h4>
   Example:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">if seq_scale &amp;amp;lt; 2
{
    seq_scale += 0.01;
    layer_sequence_xscale(my_seq, seq_scale);
    layer_sequence_yscale(my_seq, seq_scale);
}
</code></pre>
  The above code checks the value held in the
  <span>
   seq_scale
  </span>
  variable, and if it is less than 2 then it adds to it then uses the value to set the X and Y scale of the sequence element referenced in the variable
  <span>
   my_seq
  </span>
  .
