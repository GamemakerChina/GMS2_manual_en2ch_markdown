  This
  <b>
   read only
  </b>
  variable returns the index of the very last room in the game (this is defined by the order in which the rooms appear in the
  <a href="../../../../Settings/The_Room_Manager.htm">
   Room Manager
  </a>
  and
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  by the order in which they were created). Note that this variable will not recognise or take into consideration rooms that have been added dynamically using
  <span>
   <a href="room_add.htm">
    room_add()
   </a>
  </span>
  or
  <span>
   <a href="room_duplicate.htm">
    room_duplicate()
   </a>
  </span>
  .
  <h4>
   Syntax:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">room_last;
</code></pre>
  <h4>
   Returns:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml"><a href="../../../../../The_Asset_Editors/Rooms.htm">
 Room Asset
</a></code></pre>
  <h4>
   Example:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">if keyboard_check_pressed(ord("Q"))
{
    room_goto(room_last);
}
</code></pre>
  The above code checks to see if a key has been pressed and if so it goes to the last room in the game.
