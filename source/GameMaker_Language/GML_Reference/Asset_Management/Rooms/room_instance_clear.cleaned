  <h1>
   room_instance_clear
  </h1>
  This function will clear a room of all instances (no destroy events shall be called for the instances that are being removed). Note that calling this function on a room asset created in the Asset Browser
  <strong>
   will permanently clear the room of instances
  </strong>
  ,
    and even calling
  <span>
   game_restart()
  </span>
  will not return the room to it's original state (only ending the game and opening it again will start with the room in its original state again).
