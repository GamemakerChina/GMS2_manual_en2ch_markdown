  <h1>
   font_add_sprite_ext
  </h1>
  With this function you can use a "sprite strip" (the sprite itself
  <b>
   must
  </b>
  be a sprite asset from the Asset Browser, or a sprite you have added to the game resources using
  <span>
   sprite_add
  </span>
  ) to create a new font asset, where each sub-image would be an individual symbol or letter. Unlike the normal
  <a href="font_add_sprite.htm">
   <span>
    font_add_sprite()
   </span>
  </a>
  which has a specific order for the sub-images of the sprite, this function will map the sprite sub-images based on the argument "string_map" of the function. This argument is a string that you can use to tell
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  what order the sub-images of the sprite font are and it will map these automatically when writing text. So, for example, if you have a string-map of "AaBbCcDdEeFfGgHh", your sprite font
  <i>
   must
  </i>
  have the sub-images ordered in this way. You can define "space" as being any character you want, for example a single line the size that you want the space to be, and all spaces in text will be rendered at that width (but the image chosen will
  <i>
   never
  </i>
  be rendered), or if you don't supply a sprite for space then the width of the widest character in the sprite font will be used instead.
  
  
   You can also set the spacing for the font to be proportional (
  <span>
   true
  </span>
  ) or not (
  <span>
   false
  </span>
  ), where a proportional font is spaced based on the actual width of the letters (so the letter "i" takes less room than the letter "w", for example) while a non-proportional font will be spaced based on the sub-image width, like a monospaced font. Finally, you can define the space to leave between each letter when writing, and this can be any integer value, with 0 being no space (the letters will "touch" if proportional).
  
  
   The function returns an
  <i>
   index
  </i>
  value that should be stored in a variable as this will be needed in all further codes that refer to this font, or it will return -1 if the function fails for any reason.
  
  
   It is worth noting that for the font alignment functions to work (like
  <a href="../../Drawing/Text/draw_set_halign.htm">
   <span>
    draw_set_halign()
   </span>
  </a>
  ) then the font sprite should have its origin set to the
  <i>
   top left corner
  </i>
  . If you use other values then you will need to take the origin offset into consideration when drawing text using the font.
  <b>
   <span>
    NOTE
   </span>
  </b>
  When you load a font into
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  you must remember to remove it again (with
  <span>
   <a href="font_delete.htm">
    <span>
     font_delete()
    </span>
   </a>
  </span>
  ) when no longer needed, otherwise there is risk of a memory leak which will slow down and eventually crash your game.
