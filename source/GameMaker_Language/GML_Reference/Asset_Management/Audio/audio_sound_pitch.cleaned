  <h1>
   audio_sound_pitch
  </h1>
  This function can be used to change the pitch of a given sound. The sound can either be one referenced from an index for an individual sound being played which has been stored in a variable when using the
  <a href="audio_play_sound.htm">
   <span>
    audio_play_sound()
   </span>
  </a>
  or
  <a href="audio_play_sound_at.htm">
   <span>
    audio_play_sound_at()
   </span>
  </a>
  functions, or an actual sound asset from the Asset Browser. If it is an index of a playing sound, then only that instance will be changed, however when using a sound asset from the Asset Browser, all further instances being played of that sound will be changed.
  
  
   The pitch argument is a
  <i>
   pitch multiplier
  </i>
  , in that the input value multiplies the current pitch by that amount, so the default value of 1 is no pitch change, while a value of less than 1 will lower the pitch and greater than 1 will raise the pitch. It is best to use small increments for this function as any value under 0 or over 5 may not be audible anyway. It is worth noting that the total pitch change permitted is clamped to (1/256) - 256 octaves, so any value over or under this will not be registered.
  <b>

    NOTE

  The clamped value given above is what
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  attempts to clamp the range to, but this value is
  <b>
   not
  </b>
  guaranteed on all target platforms. iOS, for example, clamps to (1/256) - 8, so you may need to experiment on each target platform and have different versions of a sound resource, each one pre-shifted, should you require higher or lower octave values.

  The above code will change the pitch of the audio played from the sound indexed in the variable "s_engine" based on the value of the variable "gear".
