  <h1>
   timeline_running
  </h1>
  This variable holds current state of the assigned time line and will return
  <span>
   true
  </span>
  if it is running and false if it is not. You can also set this variable to either
  <span>
   true
  </span>
  or
  <span>
   false
  </span>
  to start and stop the time line at any time. it should be noted that a stopped time line is
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  reset, and so starting it again at a later time will start it from the exact moment that it was stopped at.
  <h4>
   Syntax:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">timeline_running;
</code></pre>
  <h4>
   Returns:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml"><a href="../../../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Data_Types.htm">
 Boolean
</a></code></pre>
  <h4>
   Example:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">if !timeline_running
{
    timeline_position = 0;
    timeline_running = true;
}

  The above code will check to see if the instance is running a time line, and if it is not then it resets the assigned time line to start at the first moment and then starts it.
