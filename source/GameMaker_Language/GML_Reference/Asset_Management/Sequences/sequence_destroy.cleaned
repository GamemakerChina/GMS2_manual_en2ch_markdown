  <h1>
   sequence_destroy
  </h1>
  With this function you can destroy a sequence object that has been created dynamically. You supply either the sequence object struct (as returned by the function
  <a href="sequence_create.htm">
   <span>
    sequence_create()
   </span>
  </a>
  ) or the sequence ID (as returned by the function
  <a href="../Rooms/Sequence_Layers/layer_sequence_get_sequence.htm">
   <span>
    layer_sequence_get_sequence()
   </span>
  </a>
  or from the sequence instance struct property
  <span>
   sequence
  </span>
  ). This function should be used whenever a dynamically created sequence is no longer required to free up the memory associated with it.
