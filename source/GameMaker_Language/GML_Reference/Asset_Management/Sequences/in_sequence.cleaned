  <h1>
   in_sequence
  </h1>
  This is a
  <strong>
   built-in variable
  </strong>
  that is part of the
  <a href="../Instances/Instance_Variables/Instance_Variables.htm">
   instance variables
  </a>
  created for every object instance in your game. If the instance is being controlled by a sequence,
    this variable will return
  <span>
   true
  </span>
  , otherwise it will return
  <span>
   false
  </span>
  . This is a
  <strong>
   read-only
  </strong>
  variable and cannot be changed.
  
  
   Note that this variable will become
  <span>
   false
  </span>
  after the controlling Sequence has ended, even if its Sequence Element still exists, and will become
  <span>
   true
  </span>
  if that Sequence element is
  <a href="../Rooms/Sequence_Layers/layer_sequence_play.htm">
   played again
  </a>
  .
  
  
   You can use this variable in your player (or CPU) controlled objects to make sure that they're only moved by code when they're not in a Sequence. This can prove useful for cutscenes, when you need to use the same instances in a Sequence (using
    the
  <span>
   <a href="sequence_instance_override_object.htm">
    sequence_instance_override_object()
   </a>
  </span>
  function) and you need to make sure that they can't be moved by their usual code while that cutscene is active.
  <h4>
   Syntax:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">in_sequence
</code></pre>
  <h4>
   Returns:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml"><a href="../../../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Data_Types.htm">
 Boolean
</a></code></pre>
  <h4>
   Example:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">if (!in_sequence) {
     x += move_x;     y += move_y; }
</code></pre>
  The above code checks the
  <span>
   in_sequence
  </span>
  variable, and if it is
  <span>
   false
  </span>
  (meaning the instance is not being controlled by a sequence) then it adds
  <span>
   move_x
  </span>
  and
  <span>
   move_y
  </span>
  to the instance's
    position, making sure that it only moves when it's not in a Sequence.
