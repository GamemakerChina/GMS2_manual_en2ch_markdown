   sequence_create
  </h1>
  With this function you can create a new sequence object which you can then add tracks to. The function returns a
  <a href="../../../GML_Overview/Structs.htm">
   struct
  </a>
  which you can then access to setup the new sequence you have created. The contents of this struct are detailed on
  <a href="Sequence_Structs/The_Sequence_Object_Struct.htm">
   this page
  </a>
  . The sequence object struct can then be used to create instances of the sequence on a room layer using the function
  <a href="../Rooms/Sequence_Layers/layer_sequence_create.htm">
   <span>
    layer_sequence_create()
   </span>
  </a>
  . Note that when creating sequence objects in this way you should remove them again by calling the function
  <a href="sequence_destroy.htm">
   <span>
    sequence_destroy()
   </span>
  </a>
  when they are no longer required, otherwise you will have a memory leak which can slow down and eventually crash your game.

 Sequence Object Struct

  <h4>
   Example:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">myseq = sequence_create();
myseq.length = 120;
myseq.loopmode = seqplay_pingpong;
</code></pre>
  The above code creates a new sequence object struct and sets its playback length and loop mode.
