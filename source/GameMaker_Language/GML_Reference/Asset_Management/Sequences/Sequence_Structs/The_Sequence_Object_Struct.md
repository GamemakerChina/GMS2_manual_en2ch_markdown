# Sequence Object Struct

A [Sequence Object
Struct](../../../../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Sequences/Sequence_Structs/The_Sequence_Object_Struct)
is the name given to the struct retrieved from a Sequence asset. All the
data for a Sequence is stored in this struct at runtime, and is
referenced by any elements of the Sequence that are created in a room.
This means that if any variables in this struct (or inside any of its
nested structs) are modified, the original Sequence will change (until
the game is closed and re-opened) and any of its existing Sequence
elements will be affected. This
[struct](../../../../GML_Overview/Structs) will have the following
properties that can be changed:

## Remarks

Note that if you want to access the properties of a sequence that has
been created in the asset browser, you must first call the function [
sequence_get() ](../sequence_get) on the asset index to retrieve the
sequence object struct. Also note that any changes made to this sequence
struct will mean that all further instances of this sequence asset will
also have these changes, and they will be maintained as long as the game
is running, even if you call the game_restart() function.
