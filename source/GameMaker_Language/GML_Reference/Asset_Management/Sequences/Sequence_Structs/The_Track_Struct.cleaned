  <h1>
   The Track Struct
  </h1>
  The track struct can be used either for top-level
  <i>
  </i>
  <a>
   asset track
  </a>
  <span>
   s
  </span>
  or for sub-track
  <i>
  </i>
  <a>
   parameter tracks
  </a>
  , and the behaviour of the track is defined by two things, its
  <b>
   name
  </b>
  and its
  <b>
   type
  </b>
  . Track
  <a href="../../../../GML_Overview/Structs.htm">
   structs
  </a>
  are created using the function
  <a href="../sequence_track_new.htm">
   <span>
    sequence_track_new()
   </span>
  </a>
  and can be retrieved from sequence assets using the
  <span>
   activeTracks
  </span>
  property from the
  <a href="The_Sequence_Instance_Struct.htm">
   Sequence Instance Struct
  </a>
  or the
  <span>

  property from the
  <a href="The_Sequence_Object_Struct.htm">
