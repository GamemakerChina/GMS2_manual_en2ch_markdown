# The Sequence Instance Struct

A sequence, when placed in a room, is placed as an **element** on the
layer, and this element contains a **sequence instance** . This sequence
instance will have the following properties in its
[struct](../../../../GML_Overview/Structs) :

## activeTracks Struct

The following list contains the properties that may be available to you
when accessing an active track struct (as included in the activeTracks
array of a Sequence Instance struct, explained above). Each asset track
struct can have any of the following properties, depending on the type
of asset the track uses (note that you can modify all these properties,
except where specified as **read-only** ), and all values returned are
for the current playhead position:
