    Sequence Object Struct
   </a>
  </span>
  is the name given to the struct retrieved from a Sequence asset. All the data for a Sequence is stored in this struct at runtime, and is referenced by any elements of the Sequence that are created in a room. This means that if any variables in this struct (or inside any of its nested structs) are modified, the original Sequence will change (until the game is closed and re-opened) and any of its existing Sequence elements will be affected.
  
  
   This
  <a href="../../../../GML_Overview/Structs.htm">

  will have the following properties that can be changed:

      This is a scalar value from 0 to 1 that is used to scale the volume of all audio tracks in the sequence. You can get or set this value and it will modify the global audio output for all tracks - for example, if you have an audio track with a volume of 0.8 and then set the sequence volume property to 0.5, the audio track will have a final volume of 0.4.

  Note that if you want to access the properties of a sequence that has been created in the asset browser, you must first call the function
  <a href="../sequence_get.htm">
   <span>
    sequence_get()
   </span>
  </a>
  on the asset index to retrieve the sequence object struct. Also note that any changes made to this sequence struct will mean that all further instances of this sequence asset will also have these changes, and they will be maintained as long as the game is running, even if you call the
  <span>
   game_restart()
  </span>
  function.
