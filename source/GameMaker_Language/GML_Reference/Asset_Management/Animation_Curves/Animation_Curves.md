# Animation Curves

Animation curves can be set up in the [Asset
Browser](../../../../Introduction/The_Asset_Browser) as assets using
the [Animation Curve
Editor](../../../../The_Asset_Editors/Animation_Curves) and they can
then be used in the [Sequences
Editor](../../../../The_Asset_Editors/Sequences) to control tracks
in a sequence. However they can also be used in your code to change
values over time in your games for anything from tweening effects on
buttons, to movement, to colour changing and more. You can also create
your own animation curves at runtime using the functions listed here,
making them a very flexible tool for your games. The available functions
for Animation Curves are as follows:

-   [animcurve_get](animcurve_get)
-   [animcurve_get_channel_index](animcurve_get_channel_index)
-   [animcurve_get_channel](animcurve_get_channel)
-   [animcurve_channel_evaluate](animcurve_channel_evaluate)
-   [animcurve_create](animcurve_create)
-   [animcurve_exists](animcurve_exists)
-   [animcurve_channel_new](animcurve_channel_new)
-   [animcurve_point_new](animcurve_point_new)
-   [animcurve_destroy](animcurve_destroy)
