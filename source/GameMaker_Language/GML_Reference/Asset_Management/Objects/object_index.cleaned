  <h1>
   object_index
  </h1>
  This
  <b>
   read only
  </b>
  variable returns the index of the object that the instance has been created from. This is
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  the same as the object name, which is a string and can be found using
  <a href="object_get_name.htm">
   <span>
    object_get_name()
   </span>
  </a>
  , as this function returns the index number, which is a unique value that
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  assigns to every object at the time of creation.
  <h4>
   Syntax:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">object_index;
</code></pre>
  <h4>
   Returns:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml"><a href="../../../../../The_Asset_Editors/Objects.htm">
 Object Asset
</a></code></pre>
  <h4>
   Example:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">obj_name = object_get_name(object_index);
</code></pre>
  The above code will use the
  <span>
   object_index
  </span>
  to find the name of the object that the current instance has been created from.
