#  GML Code  Reference

This section of the manual is a reference guide for the GameMaker
Language (GML). You can find all the available functions documented here
along with the required arguments and examples of code to show how they
can be used. For information on how to use GML please see the [GML
Overview](../GML_Overview/GML_Overview) section of the manual. NOTE
Anywhere the manual has "N/A" as a return value for a function, it means
that the function is not meant to return any value as part of its
operation. If you try to check for a return value from these functions
then you will get the value undefined .
