# buffer_set_used_size

This function is primarily for use within extensions, and allows you to
set the "used" size of the given buffer, which is the number of bytes
that have been written to it. When you write data to a buffer from an
extension, GameMaker does not know how much of the buffer was filled by
the extension code and is not able to read that data. This function can
be called by the extension to tell the engine how many bytes of data was
written to the buffer, so the engine can read that data.

#### Syntax:

``` gml
buffer_set_used_size(buffer, size);
```

|          |                                                                                       |                                                |

| Argument | Type                                                                                  | Description                                    |
| buffer   |  [Buffer ID](../../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Buffers/buffer_create)  | The index of the buffer to use.                |
| size     |  [Real](../../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Data_Types)                   | The number of bytes to set as the "used" size. |

#### Returns:

``` gml
N/A
```

#### Example:

``` gml
buffer_write(_bufferAddress, buffer_u8, 1); buffer_write(_bufferAddress, buffer_u8, 2); buffer_write(_bufferAddress, buffer_u16, 400);
 buffer_set_used_size(_bufferAddress, 4);
```

The above functions would be called in an extension to write some data
to a GameMaker buffer (through its memory address),Â and then set the
number of bytes that were written to it so the engine can read that
data.
