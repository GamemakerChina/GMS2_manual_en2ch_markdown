  <h1>
   buffer_delete
  </h1>
  With this function you can delete a buffer previously have created using the function
  <a href="buffer_create.htm">
   <span>
    buffer_create()
   </span>
  </a>
  from memory, releasing the resources used to create it and removing any data that it may currently contain.
  <b>
   NOTE
  </b>
  : It's important to always remove any dynamically created resources from memory when you no longer need them to prevent memory leaks.
  <em>
   <strong>
    IMPORTANT!
   </strong>
  </em>
  When you create a buffer, the index value used to identify it is an integer value starting at 0. These indices are re-used by GameMaker, so a destroyed buffer index value may be used by a newly created one afterwards,
    and we recommend that you set any variable that holds a bufferÂ index to -1 after having destroyed the buffer.
