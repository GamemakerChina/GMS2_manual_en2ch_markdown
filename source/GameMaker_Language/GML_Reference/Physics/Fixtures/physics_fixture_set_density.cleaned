   physics_fixture_set_density
  </h1>
  The density of something is defined as its mass per unit volume, which basically means
  <i>
   how much mass is crammed into the space it takes up in the world
  </i>
  . So, a balloon would have a low density as it has little mass that occupies a large space,
    while a lead bar would have a high density as it has a great mass, yet occupies little space.

  In the
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  2D physics world, mass is calculated automatically
    for you from the values you input for the
  <b>
   density
  </b>
  and by the
  <b>
   surface area
  </b>
  of the shape you define for the fixture. This will have a direct impact on how much inertia a fixture has as well as how it reacts to collisions and forces, so
    if you make a small shape with a high density it will have a very large mass (like a bar of lead), but if you define a large shape with a low density it will have a much smaller mass (like a balloon).
  <b>
   NOTE
  </b>
  : If you wish the instance that is going to receive the fixture to be
  <strong>
   static
  </strong>
  (ie: immobile in the game world) then the density should be set to 0, essentially giving it an infinite density.
  <span>
   NOTE
  </span>
  A static fixture can be made
  <strong>
   kinematic
  </strong>
  (ie: it can move but without the effects of force or gravity) by making it have a density of 0 and then setting the
