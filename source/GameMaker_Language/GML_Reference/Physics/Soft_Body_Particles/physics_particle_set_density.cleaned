  <h1>
   physics_particle_set_density
  </h1>
  With this function you can set the density of the particles in a physics simulation. Setting the density of the particle will have a direct impact on how much inertia it has as well as how it reacts to collisions, so if you make a small particle with
    a high density it will have a very large mass, but if you define a large particle with a low density it will have a much smaller mass. This function is
  <i>
   global
  </i>
  in scope, in that it will change the density not just for new particles created after
    the change, but also for those already present in the simulation.

  <pre><code class="language-gml">physics_particle_set_radius(15); physics_particle_set_density(0.5);
 physics_particle_set_damping(1);

  The above code will set the base properties for all particles in the simulation.
