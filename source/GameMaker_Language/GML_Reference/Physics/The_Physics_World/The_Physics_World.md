# The Physics World

Before any physical reactions can occur in GameMaker you must first
define the physics world in which they are going to happen. If you do
not do this, GameMaker will default to the basic collision functions,
and all other physics related code or settings will be ignored. You can
set up the physics world from the [Room
Editor](../../../../The_Asset_Editors/Room_Properties/Room_Properties)
, but you can also set the same properties using code with the following
functions:

-   [physics_world_create](physics_world_create)
-   [physics_world_gravity](physics_world_gravity)
-   [physics_world_update_iterations](physics_world_update_iterations)
-   [physics_world_update_speed](physics_world_update_speed)
-   [physics_world_draw_debug](physics_world_draw_debug)
-   [physics_draw_debug](physics_draw_debug)
-   [physics_pause_enable](physics_pause_enable)
