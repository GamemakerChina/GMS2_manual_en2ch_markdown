   physics_draw_debug
  </h1>
  When creating a physics system in
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  , it is often important to have a visual representation of what is actually happening with an instance. This can be achieved by using
  <span>
   physics_draw_debug()
  </span>
  , which draws a schematic outline
    of the physical properties associated with the instance running the code. Here is an image of how it looks:

  It should be noted that for this to work it
  <i>
   must
  </i>
  be in the draw event of the
    instance, and it will be drawn using the currently defined draw colour.
  <h4>
   Syntax:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">physics_draw_debug()
</code></pre>
  <h4>
   Returns:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">N/A
</code></pre>
  <h4>
   Example:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">draw_set_colour(c_red); physics_draw_debug();
</code></pre>
  The code above will draw a representation of the physical properties associated with that instance using the colour red.
