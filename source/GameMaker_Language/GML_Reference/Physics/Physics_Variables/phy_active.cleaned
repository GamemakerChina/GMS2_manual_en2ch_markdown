  <h1>
   phy_active
  </h1>
  This variable controls whether or not the instance is currently "active". Setting it to
  <span>
   false
  </span>
  will prevent the instance from participating in the physics world, and setting it to
  <span>
   true
  </span>
  will have it participating again. Please note that this is not the same as
  <a href="../../Asset_Management/Instances/Deactivating_Instances/Deactivating_Instances.htm">
   deactivating the instance
  </a>
  , as the instance is still visible on the screen and can still be changed through code, rather this function just prevents it from participating in the physics simulation
  <h4>
   Syntax:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">phy_active;
</code></pre>
  <h4>
   Returns:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml"><a href="../../../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Data_Types.htm">
 Boolean
</a>
(or undefined if the instance is not physics enabled)
</code></pre>
  <h4>
   Example:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">if keyboard_check_pressed(ord"P")
{
    global.Pause = !global.Pause
    with (obj_Parent)
    {
        phy_active = !global.Pause;
    }
}
</code></pre>
  The above code will detect a keypress of the letter "P" and then toggle the global variable "Pause" from
  <span>
   true
  </span>
  to
  <span>
   false
  </span>
  and back again. This variable is then used to set whether physics is active or not in the children instances of the object indexed in the variable "obj_Parent".
