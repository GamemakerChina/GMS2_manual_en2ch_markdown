# In App Purchases

You can add In App Purchases to your games using the extensions
available from the Marketplace and following the setup guides listed
below (each extension comes with its own "mini-manual" that explains how
to use it and lists all of the functions it contains):

-   [Android: Setting Up
    IAPs](https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360031457831-Android-Google-Play-Billing-IAPs-)
-   [iOS: Setting Up
    IAPs](https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002237257-iOS-and-tvOS-Using-The-IAP-Extension)
-   [macOS: Setting Up
    IAPs](https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002237237-macOS-Using-The-IAP-Extension)

Previous versions of GameMaker had the In App Purchase functions built
into the runner, however these functions have now been deprecated and
will no longer work:

-    iap_data
-    iap_activate
-    iap_status
-    iap_enumerate_products
-    iap_restore_all
-    iap_acquire
-    iap_consume
-    iap_product_details
-    iap_purchase_details
