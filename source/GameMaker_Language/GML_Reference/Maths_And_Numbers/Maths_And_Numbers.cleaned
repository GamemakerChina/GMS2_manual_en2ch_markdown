  </ul>
  There are a few built in constants that also can be evaluated as real numbers (although you should always check for the constant rather than the value):
  <table>
   <tbody>
    <tr>
     <th>
      Constant
     </th>
     <th>
      Value
     </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>
      <span>
       true
      </span>
     </td>
     <td>
      1 (although any value equal to or greater than 1 will evaluate as
      <span>
       true
      </span>
      )
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>
      <span>
       false
      </span>
     </td>
     <td>
      0 (although any value less than 1 will also evaluate as
      <span>
       false
      </span>
      )
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>
      <span>
       pi
      </span>
     </td>
     <td>
      3.141592653589793280etc... (the exact value will depend on various factors like the platform being targeted)
     </td>
    </tr>
