# matrix_build_identity

This will build a 4x4 identity matrix with the following structure:

``` gml
[1 0 0 0]
[0 1 0 0]
[0 0 1 0]
[0 0 0 1]
```

#### Syntax:

``` gml
matrix_build_identity();
```

#### Returns:

``` gml
 Matrix Array
```

#### Example:

``` gml
i_matrix = matrix_build_identity();
```

The above code will create an identity matrix and store its index in a
variable for future use.
