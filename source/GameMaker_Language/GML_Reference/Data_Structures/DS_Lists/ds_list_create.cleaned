  <h1>
   ds_list_create
  </h1>
  This function will create a new list data-structure and return the index value. This value should be stored in a variable and used in all further function calls relating to the list. Note that if you try and access a value in the list
  <i>
   before
  </i>
  it has been populated - i.e. the list is "empty" - then the return value may be 0 since internally the first few entries in the list are set when created to minimize performance issues when initially adding items to the list (although the
  <a href="ds_list_size.htm">
   <span>
    ds_list_size()
   </span>
  </a>
  function will still return 0 on a newly created list). If you wish to ensure that the list is "truly" empty on create, then you should call
  <a href="ds_list_clear.htm">
   <span>
    ds_list_clear()
   </span>
  </a>
  after creating the list, which will then mean that any values returned for unpopulated list slots will be
  <span>
   undefined
  </span>
  .
  <b>
   IMPORTANT!
  </b>
  When you create a data structure, the index value to identify it is an integer value starting at 0. This means that data structures of different types can have the
  <b>
   same
  </b>
  index value, so if in doubt you should be using the
  <span>
   <a href="../ds_exists.htm">
    <span>
     ds_exists()
    </span>
   </a>
  </span>
  function before accessing them. Also note that indexes are re-used, so a destroyed data structure index value may be used by a newly created one afterwards.
  <h4>
   Syntax:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">ds_list_create();
</code></pre>
  <h4>
   Returns:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml"><a href="../../../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Data_Structures/DS_Lists/ds_list_create.htm">
 DS List ID
</a></code></pre>
  <h4>
   Example:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">list = ds_list_create();
</code></pre>
  This will create a new list and assign its index id to the instance variable "list".
