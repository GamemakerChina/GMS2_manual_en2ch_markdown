  You can use the
  <strong>
   Global
   <span>
    Time Source
   </span>
  </strong>
  or the
  <strong>
   Game
   <span>
    Time Source
   </span>
  </strong>
  as a parent for your custom
  <span>
   Time Source
  </span>
  . Both
  <span>
   Time Source
  </span>
  s are globally available.
   
   
    The Global
  <span>
   Time Source
  </span>
  runs outside the main game loop, while the Game
  <span>
   Time Source
  </span>
  runs as part of the game loop.
   
   
    The choice between Global/Game doesn't affect whether
  <span>
   Time Source
  </span>
  s are affected by your game's framerate; that will depend on the
  <a href="Time_Source_Units.htm">
   unit
  </a>
  you use.
  <h2>
   Order
  </h2>
  <span>
   Time Source
  </span>
  s inheriting from the Global
  <span>
   Time Source
  </span>
  are processed
  <strong>
   before
  </strong>
  the Game
  <span>
   Time Source
  </span>
  .
  <h2>
   States
  </h2>
  The Game
  <span>
   Time Source
  </span>
  has
  <a href="Time_Source_States.htm">
   states
  </a>
  , meaning it can be
  <a href="time_source_pause.htm">
   paused
  </a>
  . The Global
  <span>
   Time Source
  </span>
  doesn't have states and can't be paused.
   
   
    You can use the Global
  <span>
   Time Source
  </span>
  for timers that should run regardless of the game state, and the Game
  <span>
   Time Source
  </span>
  for timers that are tied to your main game loop. You can then pause all of your game-related timers by pausing the Game
  <span>
   Time Source
  </span>
  .
