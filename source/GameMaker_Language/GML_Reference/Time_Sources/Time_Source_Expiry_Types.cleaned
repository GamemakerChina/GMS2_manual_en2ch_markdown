  Time Sources that use seconds as a
  <a href="Time_Source_Units.htm">
   unit
  </a>
  may not always expire on a game frame. They may expire after a game frame has been processed but before a new frame can start processing.
   
   
    However, the callback for a
  <span>
   Time Source
  </span>
  can only run on a game frame, so the expiry type of a
  <span>
   Time Source
  </span>
  controls when its callback runs, in case it expires in the middle of two frames.
   
   
    When using
  <span>
   time_source_expire_nearest
  </span>
  , the callback for a
  <span>
   Time Source
  </span>
  will run on the frame that's nearest to its expiry time, which may be the frame before it, or the frame after it.
   
   
    When using
  <span>
   time_source_expire_after
  </span>
  , the callback for a
  <span>
   Time Source
  </span>
  will always run on the frame
  <em>
   after
  </em>
  its expiry time.
