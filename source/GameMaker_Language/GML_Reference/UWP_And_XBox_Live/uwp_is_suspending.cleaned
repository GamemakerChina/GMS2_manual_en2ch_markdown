  <h1>
   uwp_is_suspending
  </h1>
  This function will return
  <span>
   true
  </span>
  for a single frame (and
  <span>
   false
  </span>
  otherwise) in a similar manner to
  <a href="../OS_And_Compiler/os_is_paused.htm">
   <span>
    os_is_paused()
   </span>
  </a>
  . The game then has one second to save the game state before it is potentially terminated by the system. Once the game has finished saving data it should call
  <a href="uwp_suspend.htm">
   <span>
    uwp_suspend()
   </span>
  </a>
  to suspend cleanly. The game should probably also enter a pause state so that if it is resumed by the system (if it hasn't been fully terminated) the player is not thrown straight back into a gameplay situation.
  <h4>
   Syntax:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">uwp_is_suspending();
</code></pre>
  <h4>
   Returns:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml"><a href="../../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Data_Types.htm">
 Boolean
</a></code></pre>
  <h4>
   Example:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">if uwp_is_suspending()
{
    scr_Save_Game_Data();
    uwp_suspend();
}
</code></pre>
  The above code checks to see if the app is going into suspension and if it is it calls a script to save the game data before suspending the game.
