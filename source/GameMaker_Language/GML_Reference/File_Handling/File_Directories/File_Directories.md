# File Directories

When working with files, there will be moments when you need to
reference the directory in which the files are stored and GameMaker has
some special functions and variables relating to the different possible
directories that you may need:

-   [directory_exists](directory_exists)
-   [directory_create](directory_create)
-   [directory_destroy](directory_destroy)
-   [temp_directory](temp_directory)
-   [working_directory](working_directory)
-   [program_directory](program_directory)
-   [game_save_id](../../General_Game_Control/game_save_id) (from
    [General Game
    Control](../../General_Game_Control/General_Game_Control) )

NOTE You cannot create or destroy directories on **HTML5** .
