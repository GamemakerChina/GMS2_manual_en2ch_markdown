   file_text_open_read
  </h1>
  This function opens the text file with the indicated filename for
  <i>
   reading only
  </i>
  , returning the unique id of the file that which should be stored in a variable as it will be used for all further actions to do with that file. If the file does not exists then the function will return the value -1.
  <b>
   NOTE
  </b>
  : You can only have a maximum of 32 files open at any one time. You should also
  <b>
   always
  </b>
  close files when finished as this writes the information and frees the memory associated with the file.
