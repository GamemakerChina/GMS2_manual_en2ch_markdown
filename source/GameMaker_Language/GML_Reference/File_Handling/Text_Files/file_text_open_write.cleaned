  <h1>
   file_text_open_write
  </h1>
  This function opens the text file with the indicated filename for
  <i>
   writing only
  </i>
  (if the file does not exist, it is created), returning the unique
  <i>
   id
  </i>
  of the file that which should be stored in a variable as it will be used for all further actions to do with that file. Note that if the file
  <i>
   can't
  </i>
  be created (because of an illegal filename, for example) the function will return -1.
  <b>
   NOTE
  </b>
  : You can only have a maximum of 32 files open at any one time. You should also
  <b>
   always
  </b>
  close files when finished as this writes the information and frees the memory associated with the file.
