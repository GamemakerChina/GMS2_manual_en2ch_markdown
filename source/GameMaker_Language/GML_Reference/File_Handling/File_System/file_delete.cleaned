   file_delete
  </h1>
  This function will delete the specified file from the system. It should be noted that this function will only delete those files that
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  is able to create and parse: ini files, text files and binary files, or those files made to store game created resources like sprites or surfaces. However, it will
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  delete any other file. The function will also return
  <span>
   true
  </span>
  if the file has successfully been removed, or
  <span>
   false
  </span>
  in any other circumstances.
  <b>
   WARNING!
  </b>
  This function may not work as you expect due to
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  being sandboxed! Please see the section on
  <a href="../../../../Additional_Information/The_File_System.htm">
