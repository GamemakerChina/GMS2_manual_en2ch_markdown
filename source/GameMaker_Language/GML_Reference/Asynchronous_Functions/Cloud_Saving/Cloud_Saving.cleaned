   Cloud Saving
  </h1>
  When making games, it is often necessary to store information about the game state in a file of some type, but storing this information on the device is not always the best option as, if the player deleted the game and then re-installs, this information may be lost. To prevent this you can use various different
  <b>
   cloud services
  </b>
  , which offer data storage over the internet for retrieval and modification at any time. You should note that this function is limited to
  <b>
   one
  </b>
  single data "blob" per game, so every time you send a new save to the cloud service, whether it is a string or a file, it will overwrite any previously stored data.

  Currently only the
  <b>
   Android
  </b>
  target uses these functions, and you need to tick the
  <b>
   Enable Google Cloud Saving
  </b>
  checkbox in the
  <b>
   Social
  </b>
  section of the Android
  <a href="../../../../Settings/Game_Options/Android.htm">
   Game Options
  </a>
  . This will prompt you to download the

   Google Services
  </a>
  extension, which is required for cloud saving on Android to function. For more information on Cloud Saving please see the following helpdesk article:

   GameMaker

  supports this with a few simple functions that work in conjunction with the
  <a href="../../../../The_Asset_Editors/Object_Properties/Async_Events/Cloud.htm">
   Asynchronous Cloud Event
  </a>
  . These functions are explained on the following pages:
