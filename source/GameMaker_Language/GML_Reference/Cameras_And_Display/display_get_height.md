# display_get_height

This function will return the height of the display (in pixels). Note
that on the HTML5 target, this value is the height of the *browser
window* , rather than the physical display size.

#### Syntax:

``` gml
display_get_height();
```

#### Returns:

``` gml
 Real
```

#### Example:

``` gml
myheight = display_get_height();
```

This would set the variable "myheight" to the display's height.
