  <h1>
   camera_set_end_script
  </h1>
  This function can be used to set a
  <a href="../../../GML_Overview/Script_Functions.htm">
   script function
  </a>
  that will be called at the end of every game frame that the camera is assigned to a visible and active view port, after everything for that view camera has been rendered. You give the unique camera ID value (as returned by the different
  <a href="camera_create.htm">
   <span>
    camera_create()
   </span>
  </a>
  functions) and the ID of the function to be called. The order in which functions attached to cameras and the actual rendering of the camera view is as follows:
  <ul>
   <li>
    The cameras for all visible and active view ports have their
    <b>
     update function
    </b>
    called
   </li>
   <li>
    Then for each view:
    <ul>
     <li>
      The
      <b>
       begin function
      </b>
      for the camera for that view is called
     </li>
     <li>
      The draw events are executed for that view
     </li>
     <li>
      The
      <b>
       end function
      </b>
      for the camera is called
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    Move to the next active visible view and repeat...
   </li>
  </ul>
