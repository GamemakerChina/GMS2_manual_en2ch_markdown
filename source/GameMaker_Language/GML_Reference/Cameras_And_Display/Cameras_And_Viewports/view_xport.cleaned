  <h1>
   view_xport
  </h1>
  With this built in array you can get or set the x position of the given view port. The view port is the area on the screen where the view is drawn, and you can have up to 8 active at any one time (the array is values from 0 to 7 inclusive to give 8
    ports). Now, the default for
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  is that the game window (or background canvas) is the same size as the room, however when you activate view ports and cameras, this behaviour changes and the
  <i>
   total size of the bounding box for all view ports
  </i>
  is used. So, if you have two different view ports at two different positions, the total area that they cover defines the size of the game window. The following image illustrates this:

  If you only have
  <i>
   one
  </i>
  view port setting the x or y value of the port can
    have some interesting effects but is not normally practical (see the image below) and so it is better to maintain the x and y position as (0,0).

  <h4>
   Syntax:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">view_xport[0 .. 7];
</code></pre>
  <h4>
   Returns:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml"><a href="../../../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Data_Types.htm">
 Real
</a></code></pre>
  <h4>
   Example:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">view_xport[0] = 0; view_yport[0] = 0;
</code></pre>
  The above code resets the position of view port[0] to the (0,0) position (top left hand corner) of the display.
