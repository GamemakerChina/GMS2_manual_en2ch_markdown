   view_camera
  </h1>
  This array holds the unique camera ID assigned to the given view port, and can be set to a new camera or read to get the current camera, returning -1 if no camera is assigned. You can have up to 8 view ports active in a room (array values 0 through 7), and can assign a camera to any of them by simply setting this variable to the camera ID value (as returned by the functions
  <a href="camera_create.htm">
   <span>
    camera_create()
   </span>
  </a>
  or
  <a href="camera_create_view.htm">
   <span>
    camera_create_view()
   </span>
  </a>
  ). If you have set the camera to a view port through the Room Editor, this variable will hold the camera ID for that port.

</code></pre>
  <h4>
   Example:
  </h4>
  <pre><code class="language-gml">if view_camera[0] == -1
{
    view_camera[0] = camera_create_view(0, 0, room_width, room_height);
}
</code></pre>
  The above code checks to see if the view port [0] has a camera attached to it and if it doesn't then one is created and set to it.
