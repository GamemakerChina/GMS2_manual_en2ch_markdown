  <h1>
   display_reset
  </h1>
  This function Resets the display settings to the ones that were set when the game was started, but also allows you to change the current level of full screen anti-aliasing being used and whether to use vertical synchronisation. The available anti-aliasing levels are 0,2,4 and 8, with the default startup value being set to 0, and the default v-sync setting is false (off). Switching v-sync on may give a smoother gaming experience but it will also need more processing power and so its impact must be considered careful before use, and the same goes for the anti-aliasing where the higher the number the more processing that is required.
  
  
   Since not all target devices are the same, some may not support 8x or 4x anti-aliasing for example, and so there is a
  <b>
   read only
  </b>
  variable available for getting the different levels of AA that the device running the game can display:
  <pre><code class="language-gml">display_aa
</code></pre>
  This variable will return an integer value based on the setting of bits for the different levels. So for only 2xAA, this will report 2, for 2x and 4x availability it will report 6. For 8 and 4 it will report 12. For all 3 levels (2,4 and 8) it will report 14.

  The above code will set the anti-aliasing level to 8 if supported and switch v-sync to on.
