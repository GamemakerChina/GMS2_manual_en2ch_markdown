#  GML Code 

The GameMaker Language (also called simply GML) is the proprietary
GameMaker **scripting language** . This language is structured to permit
users to create their games in an intuitive and flexible way while
offering all the power of any other major programming language. It is
also the basis for [GML
Visual](../Drag_And_Drop/Drag_And_Drop_Index) and can be used in
conjunction with that if required. The GML Code section of the manual is
split into the following sections:

-   [Overview](GML_Overview/GML_Overview)
-   [Reference](GML_Reference/GML_Reference)
