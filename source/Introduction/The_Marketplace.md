# The Marketplace

  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Introduction/Tools_MarketplaceWindow.png)  
The **Marketplace** is the YoYo Games on-line market for buying and
selling asset packages. An asset package can be just about anything
related to GameMaker , ie: sprites, scripts, shaders, or even full game
engines or frameworks. To be able to create, buy and sell packages, you
must first be registered on the Marketplace as a publisher and have
signed in through GameMaker (this will be automatic when you log into
the program) or from the main [Marketplace web
page](https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/) . You can find more
information on becoming a publisher from the pages linked at the bottom
of this page. **NOTE** : To be able to create or use asset packages,
**you must have previously created a user profile certificate** . You
can do this from the **Marketplace Preferences** , which is explained on
[this
page](../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/Marketplace_Preferences)
. In this window you can access your user account (and it's linked
publisher accounts) from the top right of the page, and you can also
browse and buy or download asset packages for use. You can find full
information on how to buy and download an asset package from the pages
linked at the bottom of this page. You can access the Marketplace easily
from the drop down [Marketplace
Menu](../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_Marketplace_Menu) at the top of
the GameMaker IDE, and it gives you the option to open your Library of
asset packages as well as create your own (assets or tutorials) and
update any existing packages. The Marketplace Library in GameMaker is
explained in detail on the following page:

-   [Your Marketplace Library](Marketplace/Your_Marketplace_Library)

The following pages go into the process of creating a publisher account,
listing an asset or a service, and then creating and uploading the asset
