# Our Knowledge Base

The GameMaker manual that you are reading now has all the information
that you need to use the product and start making games. However, it
does not include information on setting up for the various different
platforms that GameMaker can make games for, nor does it include any
guides or help for the various extensions that are available to extend
functionality for some platforms. It also doesn't contain any
last-minute information that may be relevant to the product or to
specific platforms that hasn't been able to be included in this manual.
However, all this information and more is available from the **YoYo
