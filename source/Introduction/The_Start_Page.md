# The Start Page

When you first open GameMaker , you will be asked to log in to your YoYo
or Opera Account (or register for one if you haven't already - see
[here](https://accounts.yoyogames.com/register) ). Once registered and
logged in, the main GameMaker IDE will open on the Start Page:

When you start GameMaker for the first time, you will be able to see a
description for each start screen element by hovering over it.

Here, you can click on the **"SKIP to Setup Wizard"** button to start
creating your first project with the help of the Setup Wizard, which
will take you through the steps necessary for creating your first game
in GameMaker .

You can also click on "Close" to close the wizard and continue using
GameMaker manually, and optionally enable the "Don't show me again"
checkbox if you do not wish to see the wizard when you start GameMaker
again.

-   **IDE Menu Bar** : This shows you the menus that you can use
    throughout the IDE; more information is given in a section below.

    between tile mode and list mode by pressing the buttons in the
    top-right corner.

## IDE Menus

At the top you can find the general IDE menus which are explained in the
following sections of the manual:

-   [The File Menu](../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_File_Menu)
-   [The Edit Menu](../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_Edit_Menu)
-   [The Build Menu](../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_Build_Menu)
-   [The Windows Menu](../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_Windows_Menu)
-   [The Tools Menu](../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_Tools_Menu)
-   [The Marketplace
    Menu](../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_Marketplace_Menu)
-   [The Layouts Menu](../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_Layouts_Menu)
-   [The Help Menu](../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_Help_Menu)

Note that there will also appear **context specific** menu options in
the top menu bar, depending on the window that you have focused on
currently. For example, if you have the Image Editor window in focus
then you will have extra menu items here for " **Images** ", " **View**
" and " **Effects** ". These extra menu items are explained in the
relevant sections of the manual for the workspace or window that
generated them.

# Starting A New Project

You can click the **New** button to create a new project, the **Open**
button to open an existing project or the **Import** button to open a
compressed YYZ GameMaker project file or a legacy GameMaker: Studio 1.4
GMX project file. Both Open and Import will open the file explorer for
you to browse to the project file you require. **NOTE** : GameMaker is
not completely backwards compatible with GameMaker: Studio 1.4 projects
but imported 1.4 projects should still run, as obsolete functionality
has been recreated for you automatically using **compatibility scripts**
. For full details of the possible issues and the changes made to GML,
please see the Help Center article [Porting A GMS 1.4 Project To
GameMaker
](https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/231719468-Porting-A-GMS-1-4-Game-To-GameMaker-Studio-2)
, as well as the section of the manual on [Obsolete
Functions](../Additional_Information/Obsolete_Functions) . To create
a new project simply click the button labelled **New** , which will open
the Template menu:  
![](https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Introduction/QS_NewProject.png)  
Select a template (or starting with a blank project), choose a name
and save location for your project, and then click on **"Let's Go!"** .
