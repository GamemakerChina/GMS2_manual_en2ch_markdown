   Creating A Marketplace Tutorial
  </h1>
  Creating a tutorial is similar to
  <a href="Creating_A_Marketplace_Asset.htm">
   creating a regular Marketplace asset package
  </a>
  , only now you have to add in specific included files as well as include an initial tutorial page (and an optional video page).
    The Tutorial workspace will look something like this:
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Introduction/Tools_Marketplace_CreateTutorial.png"/><br/>
  As explained above for general Marketplace Assets, you need to
    select a publisher and then give your tutorial a name and a unique ID (reverse URL format), and then in the "type" dropdown select Tutorial. This will then give you additional options to add a base HTML file to start the tutorial from as
    well as an (optional) video file and URL. The video file should use the template supplied from the Marketplace - as should the rest of the tutorial - which you can get
  <a href="https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/5132/tutorial-templates">
   here
  </a>
  ,
    and when the user loads the tutorial, the video will be loaded into a separate frame within the IDE. Note that the pages you give for the start page and the video page are relative paths within the Included Files, and you can open an explorer to choose
    something other than the default ones that
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  populates the fields with.
  
  
   Actually creating your tutorial will require you to add
  <a href="../../Settings/Included_Files.htm">
   Included Files
  </a>
  into your tutorial project, and these have to be added in a very specific way for the IDE to properly detect which files are to be
    used for the tutorial. The basic folder structure is shown in the image below:
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Introduction/Tools_Marketplace_TutorialFiles.png"/><br/>
  So, we have two main folders:
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     TutorialContent
    </strong>
    : All your tutorial
    <span>
     HTML
    </span>
    files, the
    <span>
     CSS
    </span>
    for styling them, and the images required for them (not the images required for resources, but the ones to be displayed
      within the tutorial), as well as the video template if required, go here. You can have sub-folders as well if you wish to split the tutorial into chapters, for example, but you should have at least one base
    <span>
     HTML
    </span>
    file
      to be used as the start page for the tutorial.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     TutorialResources
    </strong>
    : This folder has a further two sub-folders in it for
    <strong>
     Images
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
     Sound
    </strong>
    assets. If your tutorial requires the user to add a sprite (for example) and you want to include it in the tutorial
      then you would place the image resource in the Images folder. These folders are imported into the tutorial project and when the user opens the sprite editor and goes to add an image, the default path for the explorer window will be to this location,
      making it easier for the user to find the necessary assets.
   </li>
  </ul>
  For your tutorial to work within the IDE
  <strong>
   you must have this folder structure
  </strong>
  as well as have a base
  <span>
   HTML
  </span>
  start page with a
  <span>
   CSS
  </span>
  file for styling. There are a number of special links
    that can be used within your tutorial projects which will skip to parts of a video, or open the manual on a specific section or function, and these are all given in the official Tutorial templates from the Marketplace.
  <strong>
   IMPORTANT!
  </strong>
  We strongly suggest that you
  <a href="https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/5132/tutorial-templates">
   download the Tutorial Templates from the Marketplace
  </a>
  before attempting to create your own tutorials. They contain
    examples of all the important parts of the HTML as well as CSS and images to recreate buttons and menus within the tutorial, leaving you free to worry about the content rather than how to display it.
  
  
   Once you have set up the included files and supplied the required information you can click
  <em>
   Okay
  </em>
  and the tutorial will be uploaded to the Marketplace, opening a workspace on the asset listing when finished so you can edit it and add icons,
    text, screenshots, etc... Once the tutorial asset has been published, users will be able to find it within the
  <strong>
   Tutorials
  </strong>
  section of the
  <a href="../The_Start_Page.htm">
   Start Page
  </a>
  , where it can be downloaded and installed.
