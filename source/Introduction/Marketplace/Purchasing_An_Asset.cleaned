  </h1>
  To purchase an asset from the Marketplace you must first be logged in to your
  <a href="../../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/Licencing_Information.htm">
   YoYo Account
  </a>
  . Once you have created your account and logged into Marketplace, you can then
    browse the asset packages available. You can download
  <a href="https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/publishers/23/yoyo-games">
   official YoYo Games content
  </a>
  , or content created by other community members, and the content can be either paid or free.
  
  
   If you are buying an asset package for

  then you simply have to select it from the market listings and click the "
  <strong>
   Buy for [
   <em>
    price
   </em>
   ]
  </strong>
  " button. This will add the product to your shopping cart, and you
    can either proceed to the checkout or continue to browse the assets and add further purchases.

  <strong>
   NOTE
  </strong>
  : Assets that are Free will not be added to your cart, and instead you will simply be asked to agree to the terms of the

  and then, once accepted, the asset will be added
    to your library.
  
  
   When you are ready to proceed with the payment, you can select the "Cart" option from the top right of the screen and you'll be taken to an overview of the products in your cart. Here you can pay through a
  <strong>
   credit card
  </strong>
  purchase
    or though

   PayPal
  </strong>
  , or modify the purchases you are making:
