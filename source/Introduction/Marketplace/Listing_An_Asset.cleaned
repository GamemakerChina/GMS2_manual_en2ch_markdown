  <h1>
   Listing An Asset
  </h1>
  The first thing you have to do before you publish an asset is to open up the marketplace in your browser and create an
  <strong>
   asset listing
  </strong>
  . You don't have to fill out all the details here yet, but we do need to give some initial information
    so you can at least upload a package. So, log in to your YoYo Account, then go to the
  <strong>
   Publishers
  </strong>
  section and select the
  <a href="Creating_A_Publisher_Account.htm">
   publishing identity
  </a>
  that you created:
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Introduction/MP_GotoPublisher.png"/><br/>
  In the Marketplace window that opens, you will now be shown a list of the already uploaded assets (if any) along with a button marked "
  <strong>
   +Add New Asset
  </strong>
  ".
    This will present you with the following window:
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Introduction/MP_CreateAsset.png"/><br/>
  The
  <strong>
   Display Name
  </strong>
  is what will be shown as the name for the package on Marketplace, and the
  <strong>
   Package ID
  </strong>
  is what will
    be used to identify the package from
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  and within the Marketplace publisher dashboard. The Package ID must be
  <em>
   unique
  </em>
  to the asset being uploaded, and should follow reverse URL format, eg:
  <span>
   com..
  </span>
  .
  <strong>
   NOTE
  </strong>
  : Assets with a publisher ID that do
  <em>
   not
  </em>
  follow the above rule, may not upload correctly!
  
  
   This creates the initial listing for your package, and you can now either go back to the Assets page and add further listings, or continue to fill in the
  <strong>
   Market Listing
  </strong>
  details for the new asset being added. The listings page is where
    you define the type of asset package being added, as well as give details of what it contains and other relevant information:

     Primary Category
    </strong>
    : this is the type of asset that you are creating. Once you have your primary category set, you can then continue to choose further sub-categories for the sprites which will help people to find the appropriate asset
