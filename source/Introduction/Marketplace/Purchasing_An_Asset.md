# Purchasing An Asset

To purchase an asset from the Marketplace you must first be logged in to
your [YoYo
Account](../../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/Licencing_Information)
. Once you have created your account and logged into Marketplace, you
can then browse the asset packages available. You can download [official
YoYo Games
content](https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/publishers/23/yoyo-games) ,
or content created by other community members, and the content can be
either paid or free. If you are buying an asset package for GameMaker
then you simply have to select it from the market listings and click the
" **Buy for \[ *price* \]** " button. This will add the product to your
shopping cart, and you can either proceed to the checkout or continue to
browse the assets and add further purchases.

**NOTE** : Assets that are Free will not be added to your cart, and
instead you will simply be asked to agree to the terms of the EULA and
then, once accepted, the asset will be added to your library. When you
are ready to proceed with the payment, you can select the "Cart" option
from the top right of the screen and you'll be taken to an overview of
the products in your cart. Here you can pay through a **credit card**
purchase or though **PayPal** , or modify the purchases you are
making:

When you have completed the payment, you will be shown a "Purchase
Complete" screen where you can print out the receipt. You will also be
sent an email with the payment confirmation details. Once you have
completed a purchase (either of a free asset or a paid one), you can go
back to the GameMaker [Marketplace
Menu](../../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_Marketplace_Menu) and click on
the "My Library" menu itemÂ where you can download and install the assets
you've purchased. See the page on the
[Library](Your_Marketplace_Library) for more details on how to
install assets.
