  <h1>
   GameMaker Language
  </h1>
  You can use GameMaker Language to program your games in two different ways: by placing blocks to "write" code visually, or by writing code manually.
   
   
    The first option,
  <a href="Drag_And_Drop/Drag_And_Drop_Index.htm">
   GML Visual
  </a>
  , is best suited for beginners and hobbyists who want to get started making their own games quickly.
   
   
    The second option,
  <a href="GameMaker_Language/GameMaker_Language_Index.htm">
   GML Code
  </a>
  , allows you to harness the full power of GameMaker Language by writing your code manually.
   
   
    While
  <span>
   GML Visual
  </span>
  is easier to start with,
  <span>
   GML Code
  </span>
  is still an easy-to-use programming language with powerful features (

  , etc.).
  <h2>
   Creating Visual/Code Scripts
  </h2>
  You are asked to choose between
  <span>
   GML Code
  </span>
  and
  <span>
   GML Visual
  </span>
  on creating a new Object event, a new Script asset, or anything else that results in the creation of a script:

  In addition to the choice between
  <span>
   GML Code
  </span>
  and
  <span>
   GML Visual
  </span>
  , this window contains two checkboxes:
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Don't ask again for this project
    </strong>
    : When this is enabled, it sets the "Default scripting language"
    <a href="Settings/Game_Options.htm">
     Game Option
    </a>
    to your new selection, so you are not asked to choose again for the current project.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Don't ask again ever
    </strong>
    : When this is enabled, it sets the "Default scripting language"
    <a href="Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/Language_Preferences.htm">
     Preference
    </a>
    to your new selection, so you are never asked to choose again, for
    <em>
     any
    </em>
    projects.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>
   <span>
    GML Visual
   </span>
  </h2>
  This is GameMaker's
  <strong>
   Visual Scripting
  </strong>
  method that uses blocks of
  <em>
   actions
  </em>
  which are chained together to create your game's logic. The following sections explain how to use these actions:
  <ul>
   <li>
