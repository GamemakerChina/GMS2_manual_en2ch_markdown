# GameMaker Language

You can use GameMaker Language to program your games in two different
ways: by placing blocks to "write" code visually, or by writing code
manually. The first option, [GML
Visual](Drag_And_Drop/Drag_And_Drop_Index) , is best suited for
beginners and hobbyists who want to get started making their own games
quickly. The second option, [GML
Code](GameMaker_Language/GameMaker_Language_Index) , allows you to
harness the full power of GameMaker Language by writing your code
manually. While GML Visual is easier to start with, GML Code is still an
easy-to-use programming language with powerful features (
[Functions](GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Script_Functions) ,
[Methods](GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Method_Variables) ,
[Structs & Constructors](GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Structs) ,
etc.).

## Creating Visual/Code Scripts

You are asked to choose between GML Code and GML Visual on creating a
new Object event, a new Script asset, or anything else that results in
the creation of a script:

In addition to the choice between GML Code and GML Visual , this window
contains two checkboxes:

-   **Don't ask again for this project** : When this is enabled, it sets
    the "Default scripting language" [Game
    Option](Settings/Game_Options) to your new selection, so you are
    not asked to choose again for the current project.
-   **Don't ask again ever** : When this is enabled, it sets the
    "Default scripting language"
    [Preference](Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/Language_Preferences)
    to your new selection, so you are never asked to choose again, for
    *any* projects.

##  GML Visual 

This is GameMaker's **Visual Scripting** method that uses blocks of
*actions* which are chained together to create your game's logic. The
following sections explain how to use these actions:

-   [GML Visual​​​​​​​
    Overview](Drag_And_Drop/Drag_And_Drop_Overview/DnD_Overview)
-   [GML Visual​​​​​​​
    Reference](Drag_And_Drop/Drag_And_Drop_Reference/DnD_Reference)

##  GML Code 

Write GML code using functions, variables and other coding constructs,
and create your game's logic. The following sections explain how to code
using GML:

-   [GML Code
    Reference](GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/GML_Reference)
