  <h1>
   Syntax Errors
  </h1>
  The first level of error reporting when programming your games in
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  is in the code or GML Visual editor, and it's the
  <a>
   syntax
  </a>
  checker. As you right your code - or add your actions - GameMaker will check that it follows the established syntax for the language, and flag any issues that it finds so you can fix them before it comes to running the game or compiling an executable.
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Additional_Information/Errors_Syntax_Example.png"/><br/>
  These errors fall into two main categories:
  <ul>
   <li>
    <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Additional_Information/i_Error_SyntaxWarning.png"/><br/>
    <strong>
     Warnings
    </strong>
    : These are shown for things that may be an error, but may not be, and probably won't stop the game from compiling, but might provoke runtime errors. The most common causes of these warnings is when a variable is used in an expression and it hasn't been defined yet anywhere else, or when a variable has been defined but hasn't been used.
   </li>
   <li>
    <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Additional_Information/i_Error_SyntaxError.png"/><br/>
    <strong>
     Errors
    </strong>
    : These are problems that will not permit the game to compile, let alone run. These should be fixed before doing anything further with the code. The table below shows the most common causes of these.
   </li>
  </ul>
  Syntax errors will update as you write your code (there will be a short pause between typing something and any errors appearing in this window to prevent errors being reported for unfinished code), and will follow the format:
  <pre><code class="language-gml">[object] - [event] - [Line Number] - [Position In Line]: [error string]
</code></pre>
  Or if the error is in a script, it will be:
  <pre><code class="language-gml">[script] - [Line Number] - [Position in line]: [error string]
</code></pre>
  Double clicking
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"/><br/>
  on any of the errors shown in the output console will take you to the line in the object event or script that has the error so you can edit it.
  
  
   It should be noted that some of these errors will be shown at specific places in your code, but the actual error may be cause by something elsewhere, or one single issue may provoke multiple error messages:
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Additional_Information/Error_MultipleSyntaxErrors.png"/><br/>
  In the above image, all three
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Additional_Information/i_Error_SyntaxError.png"/><br/>
  errors have been provoked  by a single mistake - the use of a semi colon "
  <span>
   ;
  </span>
  " instead of a comma "
  <span>
   ,
  </span>
  " at line 220 for the function
  <span>
   variable_instance_exists()
  </span>
  .
