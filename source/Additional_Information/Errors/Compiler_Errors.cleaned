  <h1>
   Compile Errors
  </h1>
  The second type of error that can be reported for your game is the
  <strong>
   compiler error
  </strong>
  . A compiler error happens when your game encounters some type of error that the syntax checker may not have been able to detect - it's very easy to forget to declare a variable or mistakenly type a string as a real, for example - or when an error is related to how you have set up the compile tools from the
  <a href="../../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/Platform_Preferences.htm">
   Platform Preferences
  </a>
  for the target platform. These errors will be caught by
  <span>
   GameMaker
  </span>
  as the game is being compiled and this information will also be shown in the
  <a href="../../Introduction/The_Output_Window.htm">
   Compiler Error Output
  </a>
  , as shown below:
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Additional_Information/Errors_Compile_Output.png"/><br/>
  <span>
   NOTE
  </span>
  These errors don't usually pop up a window and will simply show "
  <span>
   Build Failed
  </span>
  " in the compiler output. If a window pops up it's usually a Runner Error, which is explained
  <a href="Runner_Errors.htm">
   here
  </a>
  .
  
  
   The compiler error messages will all follow the same format:
  <pre><code class="language-gml">[object] - [event] - [Line Number]: [error string]
</code></pre>
  If the error is found in a script then it will simply be:
  <pre><code class="language-gml">[script] - [Line Number]: [error string]
</code></pre>
  You can then double-click
  <br/><img src="https://gms.magecorn.com/Manual/assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"/><br/>
  on any of the compiler error entries to open the given asset at the position flagged as giving the error, and then you can use the information contained within the message to pinpoint exactly where in the object or script the error has occurred. However, sometimes these errors can seem a bit cryptic, so below you can find a complete list of all errors and a brief explanation of what they mean:

      This message simply means that some error has been discovered but the compiler cannot place what or where (if this happens consistently you may wish to contact
